<p class="ph2">PREFACE.</p>


<p>The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object, than a full display of the
noble deeds with which the Military History of our
country abounds. To hold forth these bright
examples to the imitation of the youthful soldier,
and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their
honourable career, are among the motives that have
given rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
for their skill and bravery, and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the
soldier most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command,
that every Regiment shall in future keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service, and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services, and of acts of individual
bravery, can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to every thing belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood,
"firm as the rocks of their native shore"; and when
half the World has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers,&mdash;our
fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant deeds
before us, will certainly prove acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers, will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="ph2">INTRODUCTION<br />

TO<br />

THE INFANTRY.</p>


<p>The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius C&aelig;sar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
C&aelig;sar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit,
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against C&aelig;sar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter
were armed with swords or spears only. They had
also men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes
and javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror, consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
and this <em>arme</em> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and owing to the inconvenient construction and
imperfect bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590, was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers; half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers;
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men; but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes,
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men; he caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoleers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but, so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the king added a company
of men armed with hand-grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1635, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the Second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand-grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
during the reign of George II. light companies were
added to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board
of General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the seven years' war. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarch,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate
the Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
British arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past
and present generations in the various battle-fields
where the robust sons of Albion have fought and
conquered, surrounds the British arms with an halo
of glory; these achievements will live in the page
of history to the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings,
and gallant exploits of British soldiers in the various
parts of the world where the calls of their Country
and the commands of their Sovereign, have
required them to proceed in the execution of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
duty, whether in active continental operations, or
in maintaining colonial territories in distant and
unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <em>arme</em>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and
to all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of
military tactics calculated upon mathematical and
scientific principles. Although the movements and
evolutions have been copied from the continental
armies, yet various improvements have from time
to time been introduced, to ensure that simplicity
and celerity by which the superiority of the national
military character is maintained. The rank and influence,
which Great Britain has attained among
the nations of the world, have in a great measure
been purchased by the valour of the Army, and to
persons, who have the welfare of their country at
heart, the records of the several regiments cannot
fail to prove interesting.</p>

the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in
Egypt, to that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but
His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed
on the consideration of every part of the army, that it has been a

enabled them proudly to assert the superiority of the national military
character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under circumstances
of peculiar difficulty."<cite>General Orders in 1801.</cite>
</p>
<p>
In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the
successful result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January,
1809, it is stated:&mdash;"On no occasion has the undaunted valour of
British troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority
which the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be encountered.
These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the troops
themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever advantages
of position or of numbers he may possess, there is inherent
in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not how to
yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure victory
when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means.</p>

<h2>HISTORICAL RECORD<br />

OF<br />

THE FIRST,<br />

OR<br />

ROYAL REGIMENT OF FOOT.</h2>


<div class="sidenote">882</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Royal Regiment</span> of <span class="smcap">Foot</span> is the representative of
a body of gallant Scots, formerly in the service of the
celebrated <span class="smcap">Gustavus Adolphus</span>, King of Sweden; and
of another body of Scots, many years in the service of the
Kings of France; and it claims an origin anterior to that
of any other corps in the British army; but, although a
laborious research has been made, and <em>much</em> information
procured, yet, owing to the little attention which was
paid to the history of military bodies previously to the
last century, <em>all</em> the circumstances connected with its
origin have not been ascertained. Its first Colonel was
<span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span>, a distinguished officer, well
known in Europe during the early part of the seventeenth
century; but it appears to have existed some time
as independent companies before it was constituted a
regiment. Tradition has connected its early services with
the ancient Scots Guards at the French court; and, in
order that the claims of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> to antiquity
may be clearly understood, a brief statement of the
origin and services of the Scots Guards is introduced
into this record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p>The Scots have been celebrated for deeds of arms for
many centuries, and they have been described by historians
as a hardy, valiant, and generous people. Led by
a native ardour for military fame, many Scotsmen have
quitted their own country, and, like the daring adventurers
of the remote ages, they have sought renown in
foreign lands, where they have acquired celebrity for
martial achievements, long before the practice of forming
military bodies into regiments existed. It is recorded in
history, that as early as the year 882, Charles III., King
of France, had twenty-four armed Scots, in whose fidelity
and valour he reposed confidence, to attend his person as
a guard.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1254</div>

<p>The life of <span class="smcap">Louis IX.</span> is stated to have been twice
preserved,&mdash;once in France, and afterwards in Egypt
during the Holy War, by his faithful and valiant Scots
attendants; and that monarch, after his return from
Palestine, in 1254, increased the number of Scots who
attended his person to about one hundred, and constituted
them a Corps of Guards.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The practice of having
armed Scots attendants appears to have been continued
by the succeeding sovereigns of France, and Charles V.
is stated to have placed this corps on a regular establishment.</p>

<p>When King Henry V. of England, after having gained
the memorable victory at <em>Agincourt</em>, on the 25th of October,
1415, and captured many of the principal towns and
castles of France, was acknowledged as heir to the French
throne by Charles VI., the Scots Guards appear to have
quitted the court, and to have taken part with the Dauphin
(afterwards Charles VII.), in his resistance to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>new arrangement which deprived him of the succession
to the crown. At the same time 7000 men were sent
from Scotland, under the command of John Earl of
Buchan, to assist the Dauphin, and these auxiliaries
having evinced signal gallantry on several occasions,
especially at the battle of <em>Baug&eacute;</em>, on the 22nd March,
1421, when the Duke of Clarence and above a thousand
English were killed, King Charles VII. selected from
among them one hundred "Men at Arms," and one
hundred "Archers," whom he constituted a corps of
Guards for the protection of the Royal Person, which
corps was subsequently designated the "<span class="smcap">Gendarmes
Ecossoises</span>:" at the same time, the Scots Commander,
the Earl of Buchan, was appointed Constable of France.
The Scots continued with the French army, and signalized
themselves at the capture of <em>Avranches</em>, in Normandy, in
1422; and at the battle of <em>Crevan</em>, in 1423. An additional
force of five thousand men was sent from Scotland
to France in 1424, and the Scots gave proof of personal
bravery at the battle of <em>Verneuille</em>, in 1424; and in the
attack of an English convoy under Sir John Falstolfe, in
1429; and after these repeated instances of gallantry,
Charles VII. selected a number of Scots gentlemen of
quality and approved valour, whom he constituted a
Guard, to which he gave precedence before all other
troops in France, and this guard was designated <span class="smcap">Le
Garde du Corps Ecossoises</span>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The Scots <span class="smcap">Gendarmes</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Garde du Corps</span>, continued to form part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>of the French military force until about the year 1788;
but for more than a hundred years before their dissolution
the officers and men were nearly all French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1484</div>

<div class="sidenote">1495</div>

<div class="sidenote">1509</div>

<div class="sidenote">1515</div>

<p>About the year 1484, another auxiliary force proceeded
from Scotland to France; and the Scots in the
French service signalized themselves in various parts of
Europe, but especially in Italy in the year 1495, and
they acquired the principal glory in the conquest of
Naples.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There were also Scots troops with the French
army serving against the Venetians in 1509,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and with
King Francis I. of France, in Italy, in 1515, in which
year the Scots Guards were nearly all killed in defence
of the King's person before <em>Pavia</em>, where he was taken
prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> After this fatal battle King Francis is stated
to have exclaimed, "We have lost everything but our
honour!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">1590</div>

<p>Two historical accounts of the origin and services of
the <span class="smcap">First, or Royal, Regiment of Foot</span>, have already
been printed, in which this corps is stated to be a continuation
of the ancient Scots Guards at the French Court
but this is an error,&mdash;the Scots Guards were Cavalry,
and this was always an Infantry corps, and it never sustained
any character in the French army, but that of a
regiment of the line. The supposition, that this Regiment
was formerly the Body Guard of the Scottish kings
is also without foundation.</p>

<p>Milan, a military historian of the 18th century, who
evinced much zeal and assiduity in tracing the origin of
every British corps, designates the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> an
"<span class="smcap">Old Scots Corps; the time of its rise uncertain</span>;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>and in the two editions of his succession of Colonels,
published in 1742 and 1746, he did not give the date of
the appointment of its first Colonel, <span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span>;
but, in a subsequent edition, he states the 26th of January,
1633, to be the date of this officer's commission, as Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Old Scots Corps</span>. This date appears to be
correct, as <span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span> did not quit Germany
until 1632, and no mention of a Scots <em>Regiment</em> in the
French service has been met with in any of the military
histories, or other French works (of which many volumes
have been examined), previously to 1633. This corps must,
however, have existed some time as <em>independent companies</em>,
previously to its being constituted a regiment, as
P&egrave;re Daniel, in his history of the French army,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> states,
that this regiment, which he designates "<span class="smcap">Le Regiment
de Douglas</span>," was sent from Scotland to France in the
reign of James VI. (James I. of England), and this monarch
commenced his reign in 1567, when he was only a
child, and died in 1625; hence it is evident that it had
been in France some years before its formation into a regiment,
under the command of <span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span>, took
place. P&egrave;re Daniel also alludes to this corps, in connexion
with Henry IV. of France, and thus associates its services
with the wars between that monarch and the Leaguers,
which fixes the date of its arrival in France about the
second year of his reign, viz. 1590. Francis Grose, the
author of the British Military Antiquities, does not profess
to be in possession of any information respecting the
<span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, beyond what he obtained from P&egrave;re
Daniel; and the French historians of the seventeenth
century introduce the regiment into their works abruptly,
without saying a word about its origin. Thus, the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>intelligence extant relating to the origin of this distinguished
corps, and which is corroborated by collateral
evidence, amounts to this:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">A body of Scottish Infantry
proceeded from Scotland to France in
the reign of James VI., to assist Henry IV. in his
wars with the Leaguers; and was constituted
in January, 1633, a regiment, which is now the
First, or Royal, Regiment of Foot in the
British line</span>." The companies which proceeded to
France were probably raised and commanded by men who
had served in the Scots Guards at the French Court,
which might give rise to the tradition of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment</span> being connected with that corps; and, as the
Scots Guards have ceased to exist, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> may be
considered as the representative of that ancient body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1591</div>

<div class="sidenote">1595</div>

<p>The occasion of these Scots companies being raised
and sent to France in the reign of James VI., was the
succession of Henry of Navarre, a Protestant prince, to
the throne of France, in 1589, by the title of Henry IV.,
when a sanguinary war commenced between him and the
combined Roman Catholic princes and nobles, called the
Leaguers, who opposed his accession to the throne with
all their power and influence. Queen Elizabeth furnished
the French monarch with auxiliary English forces; the
King of Scotland permitted his subjects to aid the Protestant
cause, and several companies of Scottish foot were
raised and sent to France. The British troops highly
distinguished themselves under the Lord Willoughby,
Sir John Norris, Sir Roger Williams, and other commanders.
The English afterwards quitted France, but
Henry IV., having discovered the value of these companies
of hardy and valiant Scots, retained them in his
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1609</div>

<div class="sidenote">1610</div>

<p>In 1609, and the early part of 1610, Henry IV. made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
preparations for engaging in a war with the House of
Austria; but he was murdered in the streets of Paris on
the 14th of May, 1610; and, after his death, his son,
Louis XIII., being a minor, the preparations for war were
discontinued, and part of the army was disbanded.</p>

<p>Leaving the Scots companies in France, where they
appear to have been employed in garrison duty for many
years, the Record commences the narrative of the services
of another body of Scots, under the King of Sweden, of
which the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> is also the representative.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1611</div>

<div class="sidenote">1613</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustavus Adolphus</span>, <em>King of Sweden</em>, who was designated
"<em>the lion of the north</em>," succeeded to the throne
in 1611, and he soon began to take an important part in
the affairs of Europe. Having heard of the valour of the
Scots, he procured, in 1613, a number of companies from
Scotland and from the Netherlands,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and formed two
Scots regiments. He also hired fifteen ships from the
Scots nation, which took the town and district of Drontheim,
and sailed afterwards to the southernmost shores

<p>A peace was soon afterwards concluded between Sweden
and Denmark; but Gustavus retained his Scots
veterans in his service; and in 1615 he commenced a
war with Russia. He soon rendered himself master of
the province of Ingria,&mdash;took by storm the strong fort of
<em>Kexholm</em>, and besieged <em>Plesko</em>; but he was induced to
desist from further enterprises by the pacific interposition
of King James I. of England, and a cessation of hostilities
took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1619</div>

<p>The Scots in the service of Gustavus were, however,
allowed but a short period of repose before they were
again called upon to take the field. In 1617 Gustavus
invaded Poland; and his troops were engaged in various
actions until 1619, when a truce was agreed upon by the
contending powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1620</div>

<div class="sidenote">1621</div>

<p>In 1620 the King of Sweden renewed the war; and
the Scots, under Colonels Ruthven and Seaton, distinguished
themselves at the siege and capture of <em>Riga</em>,
the capital city of Livonia. The towns of <em>Dunamond</em>
and <em>Mittau</em> were also captured soon afterwards; and
these successes were followed by another truce.</p>

<p>Meanwhile events had transpired which gave rise to
the formation of another body of Scots, with whose
services the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment is also connected. The
Protestants of Bohemia having revolted from the dominion
of Austria, elected to the throne the Count
Palatine, who was assisted by an English regiment
under Sir Horace Hore; and had also in his service
a regiment of English and Scots, under Colonel <span class="smcap">Gray</span>;
and one of the Scots companies was commanded by
<span class="smcap">John Hepburn</span>, who was the first Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment. <span class="smcap">Gray's</span> regiment was employed in 1620 to
guard the King of Bohemia's person; but after the loss
of the battle of <em>Prague</em> in 1621, His Majesty fled to
Holland. <span class="smcap">Gray's</span> regiment formed part of the force
rallied by the Earl of Mansfield; after many enterprises,
it retreated to the Palatinate, and was employed
in Alsace and Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1622</div>

<div class="sidenote">1625</div>

<p>After the Princes of the Union had made peace with
the Emperor, it retreated through Alsace and Lorraine,
and along the borders of France to the Netherlands, and
was engaged with a Spanish force near <em>Fleurus</em> (30th
August, 1622), when Sir James Ramsay and Captains
<span class="smcap">Hepburn</span> and Hume evinced signal gallantry. The army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
afterwards proceeded to Holland, and was disbanded;
when <span class="smcap">Hepburn</span> and his company entered the service of
the King of Sweden. About the year 1625, Gustavus
Adolphus appointed <span class="smcap">John Hepburn</span> Colonel of a Scots
regiment, of which the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment of Foot</span> is
the representative.</p>

<p>The King of Sweden renewed hostilities with Poland
in 1625, and conquered <em>Selburg</em>, <em>Duneberg</em>, <em>Nidorp</em>,
and <em>Dorpat</em>; and defeated the Polish army on the plains
of <em>Semigallia</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1626</div>

<p>During the succeeding year he captured several places
belonging to the Elector of Brandenburg; and in a short
time afterwards gained possession of Polish Prussia.</p>

<p>Historians have omitted to state the part which the
Scots regiments took in these services; but it is recorded
that at the relief of <em>Mew</em>, a town near the conflux of the
river Versa into the Vistula, <span class="smcap">Colonel John Hepburn's</span>
Scots soldiers highly distinguished themselves. These
veterans being sent upon a desperate service, climbed a
steep and difficult eminence with surprising alacrity to
attack the Poles.</p>

<p>"When Thurn and Hepburn had gained the summit,
which lay near the banks of the Vistula, they found the
Polish soldiers entrenching themselves, and fell on them
with incredible fury. But as the Poles poured in
fresh troops every moment, the fight was maintained
for two hours with surprising obstinacy. During this
interval Gustavus threw a supply of men and ammunition
into the town. And here, once more, it appeared
that infantry were able to resist an equal or superior
body of cavalry, for the fire of Thurn's soldiers was irresistible,
and the pikemen stood immovable, like a wall
of brass."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The Poles, dismayed at the desperate re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>solution
of their opponents, raised the siege, and Gustavus
entered the town on the same evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1627</div>

<p>The King of Sweden made his appearance in Prussia
in 1627, at the head of a brave and well-appointed army,
of which <span class="smcap">Colonel Hepburn's</span> regiment formed a part;
he took <em>Kesmark</em> by assault, and defeated, on the same
day, a division of Polish troops marching to its relief.
He afterwards besieged and captured <em>Marienberg</em>; and
defeated the Poles at <em>Dirschan</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1628</div>

<p>The army was joined in 1628 by nine thousand Scots
and English soldiers, and from this period the British
troops took an important part in the military operations
of the Swedish monarch, who was now at the head of
2,000 cavalry, 24,000 infantry, and 3,000 archers. He
repulsed the Poles in a sharp skirmish, and captured four
field-pieces and fourteen colours; and he subsequently
besieged <em>Dantzic</em>, but he afterwards relinquished his design
on this place, and captured, by surrender, <em>Newburg</em>,
<em>Strasberg</em>, and <em>Dribentz</em>, and took <em>Sweitz</em> and <em>Massovia</em>
by storm.</p>

<p>This year <em>Stralsund</em> was besieged by the Imperialists,
and two Scots regiments in the service of the King of
Denmark, with a detachment from the King of Sweden's
army, under the Scots Colonel, Sir Alexander Lesley,
assisted in the defence of the town; after a siege of
three months, the Emperor's General, Albert Count
Walstein, having half-ruined a numerous army, retired
from before the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1629</div>

<p>In the succeeding year the Emperor Ferdinand II.
commenced measures for the extirpation of the protestant
religion in Germany, where it had taken deep root for about
a century; he also sent troops to the assistance of the Poles
in their war with Sweden; but Gustavus was enabled to
oppose the united armies, and to hold them in check.
In a partial action between the advance-guards, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
miles from <em>Thorn</em>, Gustavus's hat was knocked off in a
personal encounter with one of the enemy's officers
named Sirot, who afterwards wore the hat without
knowing to whom it belonged. On the succeeding day,
two prisoners (one a Scots officer named Hume) seeing
Sirot wearing the King, their master's, hat, wept exceedingly,
and with exclamations of sorrow, desired to be informed
if the King was dead. Sirot, being thus made
acquainted with the quality of his antagonist in the preceding
day's skirmish, related the manner in which he
became possessed of the hat, upon which they recovered
a little from their anxiety and surprise. Soon afterwards
the King of Poland, having nearly exhausted his
resources, became disposed to enter into pacific relations
with Sweden, and a treaty was concluded in the summer
of this year.</p>

<p>This peace gave the King of Sweden an opportunity of
executing his design of interposing in behalf of the persecuted
protestants of Germany, in which he was abetted
by England, France, and Holland, and the Scots in his
service had the honour of taking part in this glorious
enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1630</div>

<p>Preparations were made for this great undertaking
with perseverance and judgment. It is recorded in history
that the King of Sweden had in his service ten
thousand English and Scots soldiers, well nurtured and
experienced in war, in whom "he always principally
confided, conferring on them the glory of every critical
and trying adventure." Amongst these forces, <span class="smcap">Colonel
John Hepburn's Scots Regiment</span> appears to have
held a distinguished character for gallantry on all occasions; and
no troops appear to have been found better
calculated for this important enterprise than the Scots,
who proved brave, hardy, patient of fatigue and priva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tion,
frugal, obedient, and sober soldiers. In addition to
the British troops already in his service, Gustavus afterwards
entered into a treaty with the Marquis of Hamilton,
who engaged to raise eight thousand English and
Scots for the service of the Swedish monarch.</p>

<p>When the King sailed with his main army for Pomerania,
where he arrived towards the end of June, 1630,
<span class="smcap">Colonel Hepburn's Regiment</span> was stationed under
the renowned Chancellor Oxenstiern in Polish Prussia;
but it was soon afterwards engaged in operations in
Outer Pomerania; and was subsequently again stationed
in Prussia, from whence it was suddenly ordered to
<em>Rugenwald</em>, in consequence of the following extraordinary
occurrence.</p>

<p>One of the Scots regiments<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in the service of Sweden,
commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Monro,
having embarked from Pillau in the middle of August,
in order to join the main army, was shipwrecked a short
distance from <em>Rugenwald</em> in Pomerania, which place was
occupied by a garrison of Imperialists. These brave
Scots, being cast ashore, drenched with wet, without
ammunition, and having only their pikes and swords,
and a few wet muskets, found themselves surrounded by
garrisons of the enemy, and at a distance of eighty miles
from the king and his army; yet, with astonishing resolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>and courage, under such disadvantageous circumstances,
they concealed themselves near the shore until
night, and, having secretly procured a few dry muskets
and some ammunition from a Pomeranian officer, they
took the town by a midnight assault, and maintained
themselves, fighting and skirmishing with the enemy,
until <span class="smcap">Colonel Hepburn</span> arrived with his regiment to
their relief.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>A Swedish army of eight thousand men was soon
afterwards assembled near Rugenwald, and <span class="smcap">Colonel
Hepburn's Regiment</span>, having been relieved from garrison
duty, advanced to <em>Colberg</em>, and was engaged in the
blockade of the town; a detachment of the regiment was
also sharply engaged with a body of Imperialists which
was advancing to relieve the place, but was defeated.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1631</div>

<p>During the winter the regiment marched to the vicinity
of Stettin, the capital of Pomerania: it was subsequently
employed in several operations; and in March,
1631, it was encamped at Schwedt, in the province of
Brandenburg, where it was formed in brigade with three
other Scots regiments, viz.&mdash;Mackay's, Lumsdell's, and
Stargate's. This brigade was commanded by Colonel
Hepburn, whose regiment took the right, and was designated
<span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> or the <em>Green
Brigade</em>: other brigades were also formed and designated
the <em>Yellow Brigade</em>, the <em>Blue Brigade</em>, and the <em>White
Brigade</em>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Advancing from Schwedt on the 24th of March, the
regiment proceeded with the main army, commanded by
Gustavus in person, to <em>Frankfort</em> on the Oder, and was
employed in the attack on the town. The army arrived
before the town during the afternoon preceding Palm
Sunday, and the regiment was posted opposite Gubengate.
On the following day, after divine service had
been twice performed, the King sent Captain Guntier of
the regiment, with a serjeant and twelve private men, to
ascertain if a body of troops could be lodged between the
outer and inner walls; and this little party having, with
fine courage, waded the ditch and ascended the mud
wall, gained the required information, and returned
without sustaining any loss; the King immediately afterwards
commanded the town to be attacked by storm;
<span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> was ordered to commence
the assault, and a select body of pikemen, with Sir John
Hepburn at their head, took the lead in this splendid
enterprise.</p>

<p>The fascines and scaling ladders being ready, the
King called Colonels Hepburn and Lumsdell, and
said, <em>My valiant Scots, remember your countrymen slain
at Old Brandenburg</em>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The next moment the cannon
fired a volley, and the storming party rushing through
the smoke instantly attacked the town. Colonel Hepburn
and his gallant pikemen waded the ditch, in doing
which they were waist deep in mud and water, and carried
the outer wall in gallant style. The enemy fled
from the wall towards a great sallyport, followed by
Hepburn and his valiant pikemen in full career; but
when within a few paces of the port, Hepburn was
wounded in the leg and forced to halt; his place was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>instantly supplied by the Major of his regiment, who
was shot dead the next moment; many of the pikemen
also fell, and the remainder shrank back before the
tempest of bullets which assailed them. But in a few
moments the pikemen, led by Colonel Lumsdell and
Lieutenant-Colonel Monro, returned to the charge, and
forced the sallyport; the enemy, being confounded by the
fury of the onset, omitted to let down the portcullis.
Having gained the streets, the pikemen formed up, and
a division of musketeers formed on each flank; the musketeers
opened their fire, the pikemen charged along the
street, and the enemy was routed, when a dreadful
slaughter ensued, for during the fury of the assault no
quarter was given. Lieutenant-Colonel Masten, with a
party of musketeers of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Brigade</span>, followed
the pikemen into the town, and joining in the charge,
augmented the confusion and slaughter of the enemy.
Meanwhile Major John Sinclair and Lieutenant George
Heatly, with another party of fifty musketeers of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's
Brigade</span>, scaled the walls with ladders and drove
their opponents into the town; but were immediately
afterwards charged by a troop of Imperial cuirassiers.
The brave Scots retired a few paces, and placing their
backs to the wall, kept up such a sharp fire that they
forced the cuirassiers to retreat.</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> was thus carrying
all before it, the Yellow and Blue Brigades attacked
another part of the town, where they were warmly received
by an Irish Regiment in the Emperor's service,
and were twice repulsed. The Irish behaved to admiration,
but being eventually overpowered, nearly every
man was killed; and their Colonel, Walter Butler, being
shot through the arm, and pierced through the thigh
with a pike, was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The slaughter continued for some time. The Impe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>rialists
beat a parley twice, but the noise and tumult of
the conflict was so great that the drum was not heard;
and they eventually fled over the bridge, leaving nearly
two thousand men and fifty colours behind them, besides
stores, treasure, and much valuable property, which fell
into the hands of the victors. The leading division of
pikemen of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Brigade</span>, which, after he was
wounded, was commanded by Colonel Lumsdell, captured
<span class="smcap">EIGHTEEN COLOURS</span>. This officer highly distinguished
himself; and after the town was taken, the King bid
him ask what he pleased and his request should be
granted.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Frankfort being thus gallantly won, a Scots officer,
Major-General Lesley, was appointed governor of this
important acquisition; and on the 5th of April, the King,
placing himself at the head of a select body of men from
each brigade, commanded by Colonel Hepburn, proceeded
in the direction of <em>Landsberg</em>, and while on the
march, the advance guard defeated a regiment of Croatians.
On the 8th of April a strong fort in front of the
town was attacked. The King, having through the invention
of a floating-bridge, and the ingenuity of a blacksmith,
surprised an out-guard and gained some advantage,
the fort surrendered, and the town soon afterwards
followed this example. It was a remarkable circumstance
that the garrison exceeded in numbers the besieging
army; but the valour of Gustavus's troops, and the
high state of discipline which prevailed in his army,
enabled him to perform astonishing exploits. Colonel
Hepburn and Lieutenant-Colonel Monro acquired great
credit by their conduct on this occasion.</p>

<p>After placing a garrison in Landsberg, the detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
commenced its march on the 18th of April, back to Frankfort;
and <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span> proceeded soon afterwards
to the vicinity of Berlin. Attempts were made to
induce the Duke of Brandenburg to join with the Swedes,
and when persuasion proved unavailing, the city of
Berlin was invested. The Duke, alarmed at this hostile
proceeding, sent his Duchess and the ladies of the court
to entreat Gustavus to forbear; but the Swedish monarch
proved inexorable, and the Duke of Brandenburg was
forced to comply.</p>

<p>In July the regiment proceeded to Old Brandenburg,
and on its arrival, a pestilential disease raging in the city,
the regiment was ordered to encamp in the fields. During
the same month the Marquis of Hamilton arrived in Germany
with six thousand British troops, which had been
raised for the service of the King of Sweden.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently engaged in several
operations. It encamped a short time near the banks of
the Elbe, in the vicinity of <em>Werben</em>, where an entrenched
camp was formed, which was attacked several times by
the Imperialists without success.</p>

<p>The Saxons at length united their force with the
Swedes; at the same time the Imperialists, under the
Count de Tilly, invaded Saxony, and captured several
towns, including <em>Leipsic</em>. The Swedish and Saxon armies
advanced against the invaders, and this movement was
followed by the decisive battle of <em>Leipsic</em>, in which <span class="smcap">Colonel
Hepburn's Regiment</span> took an important part.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Having passed the night in order of battle, at
day-break, on the morning of the memorable 7th of
September, 1631, divine service was performed in th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>e
Swedish army, and the troops afterwards advanced
against the enemy. The Swedes took the right, and the
Saxons the left. The advance guard was composed of
three regiments, two Scots and one Dutch, led by three
Scots colonels; and <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> formed
part of the reserve, which was commanded by Colonel
Hepburn. The engagement commenced about mid-day;
and after a tremendous cannonade, the cavalry of both
armies advanced and engaged in a series of charges, in
which the Swedish and Finland horse had the advantage;
and the King was enabled to change his position
so as to avoid the evil effects of a high wind and clouds
of dust which nearly blinded his soldiers. At length the
enemy attacked the Saxons on the left with great fury,
and drove them out of the field. The Imperialists then
directed their main force against the Swedes, and a detachment
from the Scots regiments highly distinguished
itself in a conflict with the enemy's cavalry.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> During
the heat of the conflict <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> was
moved from the rear of the centre to the left flank, which
had become exposed by the flight of the Saxons. Immediately
afterwards two columns of the enemy were
seen coming down upon the left of the Swedish army, and
the King ordered <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> to wheel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>to the left and confront the enemy. Before this movement
was executed, the Imperialists were within musket
shot; in a moment the artillery on both sides opened a
tremendous cannonade; this was followed by two volleys
from the musketeers, and the next moment <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span>
pikemen went cheering to the charge with distinguished
bravery, and, breaking in upon the front of the first
column, drove it back with terrible confusion and
slaughter. Meanwhile <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> right wing of musketeers,
commanded by Colonel Monro, fell with great
fury upon the enemy's troops which protected the cannon
and captured the guns. The slaughter would have been
great, but the ground where the battle was fought being
very dry, and newly ploughed, and the wind high, the
clouds of dust favoured the escape of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> When
<span class="smcap">Hepburn's Brigade</span> was attacking the enemy's columns,
the King sent the Blue Brigade and a body of musketeers
to its assistance; but before the arrival of these reinforcements
the Scots were triumphant. The Imperial
columns being broken, the Swedish horsemen pursued
the fugitives until dark and made great slaughter. Success
having attended the Swedish arms in other parts of
the field, the victory was complete; but the conquerors
had the misfortune to lose their baggage, which was
plundered by their friends, the runaway Saxons.</p>

<p>The Scots gained great honour in this action, particularly
the brigade of which <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> regiment formed
part. Colonel Monro, who commanded the right wing of
musketeers, writes&mdash;"The victory and credit of the day
was ascribed to our brigade; we were thanked by hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>s
Majesty for our service in a public audience, and in
view of the whole army, and we were promised to be
rewarded." In another place the same author observes&mdash;"His
Majesty did principally, under God, ascribe the
glory of the victory to the Swedish and Finland horsemen,
who were led by the valorous Velt-Marshal
Horne; for though the Dutch horsemen did behave
themselves valorously divers times that day, yet it was
not their fortune to make the charge which did put the
enemy to flight; and though there were brave brigades
of Swedes and Dutch in the field, yet it was the <span class="smcap">Scots</span>
brigades' fortune to gain the praise for the foot service,
and not without cause, for they behaved themselves
well, being led and conducted by an expert and fortunate
cavalier, the valiant <span class="smcap">Hepburn</span>."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The pursuit was continued until the Imperial army
was literally cut to pieces, excepting a few regiments,
which, being favoured by the clouds of dust and smoke,
escaped. The Imperial camp was left standing, and the
Swedish troops passed the night in their enemy's tents.
The Imperial cannon, the greater part of the baggage,
and many standards and colours, were captured by the
victorious Gustavus. Such were the results of the
famous battle of <em>Leipsic</em>,&mdash;the most important action
which had been fought for more than half a century,&mdash;and
where the regiment, which is now represented by
the <span class="smcap">First</span>, or <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, in the British line,
acquired great honour.</p>

<p>After passing the night on the field of battle the army
assembled in column, and divine service was again performed;
after which the King of Sweden addressed the
several regiments on the subject of their exploits on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
preceding day, and again returned thanks to <span class="smcap">Hepburn's
Scots Brigade</span> for its distinguished gallantry.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> From
the field of battle the army advanced to <em>Leipsic</em>, and invested
the town, but the recapturing of this place was
left to the Saxons. Meanwhile part of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's
Brigade</span> proceeded to <em>Halle</em>, and captured the town
and castle on the 11th of September. While the army
lay near this place several protestant Princes, with the
Elector of Saxony at their head, visited the King, on
which occasion his Majesty passed many encomiums on
the Scottish nation, and beckoning to Colonel Hepburn,
who stood in another part of the room, recommended
him, Lumsdell, and Monro, to the Elector's more immediate
notice.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From Halle the brigade marched to Erfurt, in the
famous forest of Thuringia, and was afterwards destined
to take part in the reduction of the Circle of Franconia.
From Erfurt the brigade advanced, with other troops,
through the forest of Thuringia,&mdash;proceeded a distance
of one hundred and eleven miles along difficult roads,
and took by capitulation six large towns, in the short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>period of eight days. Having arrived at <em>Wurtzburg</em>,
the town soon surrendered; but a strong castle, called
<em>Marienberg</em>, standing on an eminence on the other side
of the river Maine, being garrisoned by a thousand men,
well provided with every means of defence, held out
against the Swedish arms, and the Scots were selected to
commence operations against this place. The approach
was hazardous beyond description; one arch of the
bridge was blown up, and the batteries raked the bridge
from one end to the other. A few daring Scots musketeers,
however, passed the river in small boats on the
5th of October, and, leaping on shore in the face of a
sharp fire, were soon warmly engaged. A plank had, in
the meantime, been laid across the broken arch of the
bridge, and a number of veteran Scots running across
one after another, joined their companions in the fight,
and a lodgment was effected beyond the river, and some
advantage gained. The castle was afterwards taken by
storm; and this having been deemed an impregnable
fortress, it was found well stored with corn, wine, ammunition,
and treasure; and small arms were found for
seven thousand men.</p>

<p>While the brigade lay at Wurtzburg, the King sent
out so many detachments that he had only about ten
thousand men at head-quarters, and an army of fifty
thousand men, commanded by the Duke of Lorraine, advanced
against him. His Majesty having received information
that the enemy designed to pass the Maine at
<em>Oxenford</em> and attack him, the King proceeded, on the
same evening, after dark, to the quarters of <span class="smcap">Hepburns's
Scots Brigade</span>, and commanded the men to assemble
under arms immediately. Having selected eight
hundred musketeers, his Majesty commanded them to
follow him, while the pikemen and colours remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
behind. The musketeers, being led by Brigadier-General
Hepburn, and accompanied by eighty Swedish
horsemen, continued their march throughout the night,
and at two o'clock on the following morning arrived at
<em>Oxenford</em>, and formed up in the market-place, while
fifty of the horsemen advanced to observe the motions of
the enemy. Soon afterwards the report of pistols was
heard, when his Majesty sent out a lieutenant and fifty
musketeers to skirmish and to cover the retreat of the
horse, which service was gallantly performed. The
enemy, however, proved too numerous, and the fifty
musketeers were forced to retire, when the King sent a
hundred musketeers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Monro,
to restore the fight, and they drove back a superior body
of the Imperialists, for which they were applauded by
the King. These few Scots having thus frustrated the
designs of the enemy, his Majesty returned to Wurtzburg,
leaving Hepburn, with his musketeers, to defend
the place; and this excellent officer made such a
formidable disposition of his men, and kept so good a
countenance, that, although the enemy advanced with
his army up to the town with drums beating and
colours flying, as though he was about to storm the
place, yet he afterwards retired. The musketeers,
having thus boldly confronted a large army and maintained
their post, were afterwards ordered to return to
Wurtzburg.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span>,
or the <span class="smcap">Green Brigade</span>, advanced with the army
towards <em>Frankfort on the Maine</em>, a place celebrated
throughout Europe for its annual fairs; and while traversing
the rich plains and beautiful scenery of one
of the most fruitful parts of Germany, several strong
towns surrendered to the army. The brigade crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the Maine at Aschaffenberg, on the 14th of November,
and arrived at Frankfort on the 16th, when the city
surrendered.</p>

<p>In the early part of December <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> or the
<span class="smcap">Green</span>, and the Blue brigades, were employed in the
siege of a strong fort near <em>Oppenheim</em>, and while performing
this service, these hardy veterans were encamped
in the midst of a deep snow. The enemy made a sally
in the night, but were repulsed by the Scots pikemen,
and on the following morning the fort surrendered. The
two brigades afterwards attacked a fort, and also the
castle belonging to the town. A party of gallant Scots
having stormed the wall between the outward fort and
castle, they found the drawbridge down, and, forcing an
entrance into the castle, they put the Spanish garrison to
the sword; at the same time another party stormed the
fort with such fury that nine companies of Italians were
soon overpowered and forced to surrender. These
Italians afterwards engaged in the Swedish service, and
were attached to the <span class="smcap">Green Brigade</span>; but they all deserted
during the following summer. The King having
passed the Rhine with part of his army to attack the
town on the other side, the place surrendered.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the severity of the season, the King
resolved to continue operations, and one Sunday afternoon,
in the early part of December, in tempestuous
weather, with frost and snow, the army appeared before
<em>Mentz</em>. <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots</span>,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> or the <span class="smcap">Green Brigade</span>,
took its post before the town; and the men having prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>the batteries during the night, the fire of the cannon
commenced at day-break with such fury that the besieged
were dismayed, and they surrendered in the middle of
December. The brigade was afterwards placed in garrison
in the town, where it continued during the remainder
of the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1632</div>

<p>During the preceding campaign, several additional
regiments arrived in Germany from Scotland, namely,
Sir James Lumsdell's, the Master of Forbes', Sir Frederick
Hamilton's, and Colonel Monro's; also Colonel
Austin's English regiment; recruits also arrived for the
old regiments; and in the beginning of 1632 there
appear to have been thirteen Scots regiments and five
English regiments in the service of the King of Sweden.
There were also two Scots generals, three major-generals,
three brigadier-generals, twenty-seven colonels, fifty-one
lieutenant-colonels, and fourteen Scots majors,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in the
Swedish army: and the <span class="smcap">First</span>, or <span class="smcap">Royal, Regiment of
Foot</span>, in the British line, being the only one of these
eighteen British regiments which has continued to exist
to the present time, it is the representative of the whole
of this gallant force.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> veterans remained in garrison at Mentz,
recruiting in vigour and in numbers, until the beginning
of March, 1632, when they proceeded to Frankfort on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the Maine, and, advancing from thence to Aschaffenberg,
were reviewed in the fields before the town on the
6th of March, by the King of Sweden. From Aschaffenberg
the brigade continued its march to Weinsheim,
where it was reviewed by the Elector Palatine, who
complimented this distinguished body of Scots on the
high character it had acquired for deeds of valour.</p>

<p>After this review the brigade advanced with the army
to invade Bavaria, and on the 26th of March it appeared
before <em>Donawerth</em> on the Danube, when the King posted
part of the troops on the heights above the town. On
the following day, a battery having been constructed to
command the bridge, the enemy made a furious sally,
and, having driven back some Swedish troops, captured
the guns; but a number of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> veterans rushing
forward sword in hand, the Bavarians were repulsed and
driven back into the town. During the night, Sir John
Hepburn marched his brigade with great silence five
miles up the Wernitz, and having crossed the river, returned
by the opposite bank to an angle which commanded
the bridge over the Danube, where he posted his
musketeers behind garden-walls and hedges, and formed
the pikemen into three bodies under the cover of the
enclosures. At day-break the enemy's garrison attempted
to force its way through the besieging army; eight
hundred musketeers rushed suddenly out of the town
towards the bridge where <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> men were posted,
when the Scots musketeers opened a destructive fire, and
before the smoke had cleared away, the pikemen came
cheering forward to the charge, while the musketeers
drew their swords and joined in the attack, and the
enemy's column was broken and cut to pieces. Many of
the Bavarians fled towards the town; <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> veterans,
following in full career, entered the town with the fugi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>tives,
and made great slaughter in the streets. Meanwhile,
the enemy's troops, which sallied on the other side
of the town, were also nearly all destroyed. The
governor escaped, but he saved only a small portion of
his garrison. Thus Donawerth was captured in forty-eight
hours after the army appeared before the town;
and in this exploit the gallant veterans under Sir John
Hepburn acquired new laurels.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>This success enabled the King to penetrate into Bavaria;
and in the early part of April <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Brigade</span>
took part in the brilliant enterprise of forcing the passage
of the river <em>Lech</em> in the face of a superior army, and the
success which attended this daring exploit alarmed one
half of Europe, and astonished the other.</p>

<p>The brigade was afterwards engaged in the siege of
<em>Augsburg</em>, which place capitulated on the 10th of April.
From Augsburg the brigade proceeded with the army to
<em>Ingoldstadt</em>, and, being engaged in the siege of this town,
it had one very trying night's service: the King, expecting
a sally from the garrison, ordered Hepburn's
veterans to stand all night under arms on some high
ground near the town; the enemy kept up a constant
fire against the brigade with dreadful execution, and the
men had to stand like targets to be shot at, without the
power of making resistance. "To my mind," observes
the brave Colonel Monro, "it was the longest night in
the year, though in April, for at one shot I lost twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
men of my own company." The first attack not succeeding,
the King raised the siege and retired.</p>

<p>After quitting the precincts of Ingoldstadt, the brigade
was detached against <em>Landshut</em>, a pretty little town with
a castle, in Bavaria, which place surrendered on the 29th
of April.</p>

<p>Having completed this conquest, the brigade proceeded
to Freysingen, where it rejoined the main army, and
advanced from thence to <em>Munich</em>. This celebrated city
surrendered immediately, and the King being desirous of
preserving it from plunder, he made a present of about
five shillings English to every soldier in the army, and
posted <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Brigade</span> at the bridge to prevent
the ingress of stragglers. The army was afterwards
encamped without the town, excepting the old Scots
brigade, which entered the city with the King, and
<span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> own regiment furnished the guard at the
market-place, while the remainder of the brigade furnished
the King's guard at the castle. As no other
brigade was admitted into Munich, this circumstance
proves the high estimation in which this old Scots
corps was held. Its commander, Brigadier-General
Hepburn, was appointed governor of Munich.</p>

<p>Leaving this city on the 1st of June, the brigade again
directed its march towards Donawerth, where it arrived
on the 4th. It subsequently marched to the relief of
<em>Weissemberg</em>, which was besieged by the enemy; but
the garrison surrendered before the troops marching for
its relief arrived. The brigade then continued its
march to Furt, where an encampment was formed. It
was afterwards employed in several operations of a defensive
character. The King having to defend <em>Nurenberg</em>,
and to confront an army of 60,000 men with only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
20,000, his Majesty formed an entrenched camp round
the city, where the brigade was stationed some time.</p>

<p>The enemy's army, commanded by the Duke of
Bavaria and Count Walstein, appeared before Nurenberg,
and by means of their immense superiority of
numbers endeavoured to cut off the supplies of provision
from the Swedish army, but were unable to accomplish
their object. The opposing armies lay watching each
other's movements until the 21st of August, when, reinforcements
having arrived for the Swedes, the King
attacked the enemy's fortified camp; the old Scots
Brigade was sharply engaged in the attack of the heights
of Altenberg, and in the attempt on Altenberg Castle, in
which service it lost many officers and men; but the
attack failed at every point. The King afterwards
formed a fortified camp within cannon shot of the enemy,
and the two armies confronted each other until the 8th of
September, when his Majesty retired, and five hundred
musketeers of the old Scots Brigade, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Sinclair, covered the retreat to Neustadt.
A few days afterwards, the Marquis of Hamilton being
about to return to England, Brigadier-General Hepburn
obtained permission to accompany him, and the regiment
was left under the command of the Lieutenant-Colonel.
When the gallant Hepburn and several other officers
took leave of their companions in arms, Monro informs
us that "the separation was like the separation which
death makes betwixt friends and the soul of man,
being sorry that those who had lived so long together
in amity and friendship, also in mutual dangers, in
weal and in woe, the splendour of our former mirth
was overshadowed with a cloud of grief and sorrows,
which dissolved in mutual tears."</p>

<p>The brigade was now commanded by Colonel Monro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and towards the end of September it marched to the
relief of <em>Rayn</em>, which was besieged by the enemy; but this
garrison also surrendered before the troops marching to
its relief arrived. The King, however, resolved to retake
the town, and having arrived before the walls on the 3rd
of October, he took advantage of a thick fog, and brought
his cannon to bear upon the works unperceived, when
the garrison immediately surrendered.</p>

<p>The brigade being much exhausted and decreased in
numbers from its recent hard services, it was placed in
quarters of refreshment in Bavaria, while the King
marched with part of the army into Saxony. Before his
departure, his Majesty expressed his approbation of the
conduct of these veteran Scots on all occasions, and exhorted
the commanding officers to use every possible
expedition in replacing the casualties in the ranks of their
respective regiments; but this proved the final separation
between the great Gustavus Adolphus and these distinguished
regiments; his Majesty marched to Saxony, and
was killed at the battle of L&uuml;tzen,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which was fought on
the 6th of November, 1632.</p>

<p>After the death of the King of Sweden<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> the old Scots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Brigade served for a short time under the Elector
Palatine, and was employed in the siege and capture of
<em>Landsberg</em>, a town of Upper Bavaria on the Lech; and
while before this place a dispute about precedence arose
between this and another (Ruthven's) brigade: "But,"
observes Colonel Monro, "those of Ruthven's Brigade
were forced, notwithstanding their diligence, to yield the
precedence unto us, being older blades than themselves,
for in effect we were their schoolmasters in discipline,
as they could not but acknowledge."</p>

<p>When the capture of Landsberg was effected, the
old Scots Brigade marched to the relief of <em>Rayn</em>, which
was closely beset by the Bavarians, who raised the siege
on the approach of the Scots, and retired into Saxony.</p>

<p>From Rayn the brigade marched to the vicinity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ancient city of Augsburg, where the men lay two months
of extreme cold weather in the open fields; the loss of
the great Gustavus Adolphus was now seriously experienced,
the generals were indecisive, and operations were
suspended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1633</div>

<p>But in February, 1633, the brigade was again called
into action. It proceeded, in the first instance, to Ulm,
a considerable town on the banks of the Danube, and
from thence towards <em>Memmingen</em>, to attack a division of
the enemy stationed in the town; but, having halted at
some hamlets within three miles of the place, the houses
took fire in the night, and the brigade lost much baggage,
and saved its cannon and ammunition with difficulty.
This misfortune did not, however, prevent the
troops from marching against their adversaries, who
after some sharp skirmishing, retired.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the brigade proceeded to <em>Kaufbeuren</em>,
a small town on the Wertach, and having invested the
place, the garrison held out two days, and then surrendered.
Having refreshed the men with three days' rest
at Kaufbeuren, the brigade marched with part of the
army towards the Iller, and, having passed the river by a
temporary bridge, besieged <em>Kempten</em> (the ancient <em>Campodunum</em>).
But while the brigade lay before the town,
it was suddenly ordered to proceed by forced marches to
the Duchy of Wirtemberg.</p>

<p>Having been recalled from Wirtemberg, the brigade
proceeded to Donawerth on the Danube, where it was
stationed during a great part of the summer; while a
convention of the Protestant princes of Germany was
held at Heilbronn. The pay of the troops being a long
time in arrear, they resolved not to engage in any further
operations until their arrears were paid. Thus disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and confusion found its way into the Swedish army, and
the Scots regiments were no longer recruited with the
same facility as formerly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1634</div>

<p>The old Scots Brigade, however, continued at its post
of duty, and it formed part of the army, commanded by
Marshal Horn and the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, which
advanced to the relief of <em>Nordlingen</em>; and this movement
brought on a general engagement, which was fought
in the vicinity of the town on the 26th of August, 1634,
when the confederates were defeated, and the Scots Brigade
suffered so severely, that one of the regiments
(Monro's) was reduced a few days afterwards to one
company.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> After the battle, the wreck of this distinguished
brigade retreated to Worms, a town situate on
the left bank of the Rhine; and, Marshal Horn having
been taken prisoner, the veteran Scots were under the
orders of the Duke of Saxe-Weimar.</p>

<p>The loss of the battle of <em>Nordlingen</em> almost ruined the
protestant interest in Germany, but soon afterwards the
court of France agreed to support this depressed and
declining cause. The prospect of immediate succours
from France allayed the consternation which prevailed
amongst the confederate princes. A French army approached
the Rhine, and several towns in Alsace admitted
French garrisons.</p>

<p>In the French army which thus approached the Rhine,
the celebrated <span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span> appeared at the head
of a Scots regiment in the French service. When this
officer quitted Germany in 1632 (as before stated), he
was not satisfied with the manner in which the Swedish
affairs were conducted: on his arrival in England he
was knighted; in the following year he tendered his services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to Louis XIII.; and a regiment having been constituted
of the old Scots companies and some newly-raised
men, he was appointed its Colonel, by commission dated
the 26th of January, 1633. He served in 1634 with the
French army,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> commanded by Marshal de la Force.
During the summer he was engaged in the siege of <em>La
Motte</em> (or La Mothe), which place surrendered on the
26th of July; and <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span> lost one captain
and several men in this service. On the 19th of December,
Sir John Hepburn passed the Rhine with his own and
six other regiments of infantry, seven cornets (or troops)
of cavalry, and a train of artillery, and took post at
Manheim, from whence he sent forward parties to reconnoitre
the enemy. The remainder of the French army
afterwards passed the Rhine, and Sir John Hepburn
marched to the relief of <em>Heidelberg</em>, an ancient city
situate on the river Neckar, at the foot of the mountain
called the Giesberg. This city was besieged by the Imperialists,
and defended by the Swedes. After some
sharp fighting, in which Sir John Hepburn distinguished
himself, the besieging army retreated, and the city was
delivered to the French on the 23rd of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1635</div>

<p>After this success, part of the French army marched
to Landau, and formed a junction with the Swedish
forces under the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, which had
escaped after the defeat at Nordlingen. Thus the remaining
few veterans of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Regiment</span> in
the <em>Swedish service</em>, and <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Scots Regiment</span> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the <em>French service</em>, were brought into contact to fight
together in the same cause, and the two regiments appear
to have been incorporated into one. This union would,
doubtless, prove agreeable to both corps; the veterans in
the Swedish service had long been without pay, and the
strongest attachment existed between them and their
former leader, Sir John Hepburn, who had been their
companion in toil, in danger, and in victory; and this
union of the two corps placed them again under their
favourite commander: at the same time, Hepburn's regiment
in the French service was already much decreased
in numbers from a long campaign, and the addition of
these renowned veterans would prove a valuable acquisition.
Thus Hepburn's Regiments, or <em lang="fr">Le R&eacute;giment
d'Hebron</em> in the <span class="smcap">Swedish service</span>, and <em lang="fr">Le R&eacute;giment
d'Hebron</em> in the <span class="smcap">French service</span> (for the French historians
use the same title for both regiments), appear to have
become one corps in 1635; and there is reason to believe
that the remains of several other Scots corps in the
Swedish service were added to <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span>, as
its establishment, two years afterwards, is stated to have
amounted to the extraordinary number of 8316 officers
and soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> There appear also to have been two other
Scots regiments in the French service in 1635, namely,
Colonel Lesley's and Colonel Ramsay's, besides the Scots
<em lang="fr">Gardes du Corps</em> and <em lang="fr">Gendarmes</em> spoken of at the
beginning of this Memoir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span> served during the campaign of
1635 with the French array in Germany, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by the Cardinal de la Valette; and the remains of the
Swedish army, which had escaped after the defeat at
Nordlingen in 1634, continued to co-operate with the
French, and were commanded, under the Cardinal, by
the Duke of Saxe-Weimar. Little advantage, however,
accrued from placing an ecclesiastical dignitary at the
head of the army. The supplies of provision were intercepted
by the Germans, the French troops were reduced
to the necessity of subsisting on roots gathered about the
villages, and the horses were fed on the leaves of trees.
At length the army, after burying its cannon and destroying
its baggage, retreated through mountainous
parts of the country; the Germans followed and attacked
the rear; <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span> was sharply engaged
amongst the mountains; and the Imperialists were severely
punished for their temerity in a sharp action in September,
near <em>Metz</em>.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1636</div>

<p>During the summer of 1636 <span class="smcap">Hepburn's Regiment</span>
served with the army commanded by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar,
and in the month of May it appeared before
<em>Saverne</em>, a town of Alsace, situated on the banks of the
river Sarre, which was defended by an Imperial garrison
commanded by Colonel Mulhein. The siege of this
place was immediately commenced, and the garrison made
a desperate resistance. A breach having been effected,
three assaults were made on the 20th of June, and were
repulsed with great loss. On the following day the batteries
against the town opened their fire with greater fury
than before, and during the progress of the siege the
gallant Sir John Hepburn<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> was shot in the neck, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>died, regretted, not only by his old companions in arms,
but also by the court of France, where his valour and
abilities were well known and appreciated. After holding
out a few days longer the garrison surrendered; and
Louis XIII. conferred the vacant Colonelcy of the regiment
on Lieutenant-Colonel James Hepburn, whose
name appears amongst the Scots lieutenant-colonels in
the service of the King of Sweden in 1632.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1637</div>

<p>The regiment appears to have continued to serve in
Alsace, under the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, whose army
consisted of French, Scots, Swedes, and Germans, in the
pay of France; and during the year 1637 it was engaged
in several skirmishes with the Imperialists, but no considerable
action was performed by either side.</p>

<p>This year Colonel James Hepburn was killed, and he
was succeeded in the command of the regiment by Lord
James Douglas, second son of William, first Marquis of
Douglas. From this period the regiment was known in
France by the title of <em lang="fr">Le R&eacute;giment de Douglas</em>.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>While the regiment was in Alsace, Picardy was invaded
by the Spaniards, and in 1637 this corps of hardy
Scots appears to have been withdrawn from the army
commanded by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and stationed
near the frontiers of Picardy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1638</div>

<p>In the spring of 1638 it was placed under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
of the Marshal de Chastillon, for the purpose of penetrating
into the Earldom of Artois, which at this period
formed part of the Spanish Netherlands.</p>

<p>The army having been assembled near Amiens, passed
the Somme on the 18th of May, 1638; <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span>,
forming part of the division under Lieutenant-General
Hallier, passed the river at Abbeville, marched
from thence to Doullens, and, after taking part in the
capture of several small forts, was engaged in the siege
of <em>St. Omer</em>, a place of great strength, and provided
with a good garrison. The trenches were opened on the
night between the 29th and 30th of June. On the 12th
of July three hundred of the garrison issued out of the
town to attack the men in the trenches, and encountering
a party of <span class="smcap">Douglas' Scots</span>, a fierce combat ensued, and
the Spaniards were driven back with the loss of many
men killed and taken prisoners; the enemy also lost a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>strong post which they had held until that time.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> A
Spanish force, however, advanced to the relief of the
garrison, and having succeeded in throwing succours into
the town, the siege was raised by the French.</p>

<p>After quitting the vicinity of St. Omer, the regiment
was engaged in the siege of <em>Renty</em>, a small town on the
river Aa. The army appeared before this place on the
1st of August, and on the 9th the garrison surrendered.</p>

<p>The next service in which the troops were employed
was the siege of <em>Catelet</em>, a town of Picardy, which the
Spaniards had captured in 1636; and this place was
taken by storm on the 14th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1639</div>

<p>Having passed the winter in quarters in Picardy,
<span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> marched in the early part of May,
1639, to the rendezvous of the army at Doullens, and
served this year against the Spaniards, forming part of
the army commanded by General Meilleraie. The French
commander marched first towards Aire, but after reconnoitering
the defences of this place, he proceeded to
<em>Hesdin</em>,&mdash;a town situated amongst marshes on the little
river Canche, where he arrived on the 19th of May, and
commenced the siege of the place with great vigour.
Louis XIII. visited the camp, that his presence might
animate the soldiers in their attacks; and, the garrison
having surrendered on the 29th of June, the King was
so well pleased with the manner in which this siege had
been conducted, that he presented General Meilleraie
with the baton of a Marshal of France; the ceremony
was performed in the breach he had made in the fortress,
and the King commanded <i lang="la">Te Deum</i> to be sung in the
principal church of the town.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>After repairing the works, the army advanced against
the Spanish forces under the Marquis de Fuentes; and
<span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> took part in a sharp skirmish near
the village of <em>St. Nicholas</em>, on which occasion four pieces
of cannon were captured from the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1640</div>

<div class="sidenote">1641</div>

<div class="sidenote">1642</div>

<p>The regiment continued to take part in the military
operations against the Spaniards. Meanwhile Scotland
was violently agitated by an attempt made by King
Charles I. to introduce the English Liturgy. This was
followed by an unfortunate misunderstanding between
the King and his Parliament in England, which produced
a civil war; but, in the scenes of slaughter and devastation
which followed, this regiment did not take part.
It was in the service of Louis XIII. of France, who was
engaged in a war with Austria and Spain; and the
French King had urgent occasion for the presence of the
three Scots regiments<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> with his armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1643</div>

<p>While the civil war was raging in England, Louis
XIII. died (14th May, 1643), and was succeeded by
his son Louis XIV., who was afterwards designated
<em>Louis le Grand</em>; at the time of his accession he was
in his minority. Notwithstanding this event the war
was prosecuted with vigour, and the court of France
procured, in 1643, an additional regiment of foot from
Scotland, commanded by Colonel Andrew Rutherford,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
afterwards Earl of Teviot. This regiment was designated
in France <em lang="fr">Le R&eacute;giment des Gardes Escossois</em>, or
the <span class="smcap">Regiment of Scots Guards</span>: but the title was only
honorary, as it was never employed near the royal person.
The date of its formation has not been ascertained;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>but, as it was afterwards incorporated into <span class="smcap">Douglas'
Regiment</span>, now the <span class="smcap">First Royals</span>, this corps is its
representative, and its services have a place in this
Memoir.</p>

<p>Immediately after the regiment of Scots Guards arrived
in France, it was ordered to advance to the relief
of <cite>Roucroy</cite>, a town of the Ardennes, which was besieged
by the Spaniards. The troops employed in this service
were commanded by Louis de Bourbon, Duc d'Enghien,
who was afterwards celebrated for military achievements
under the title of <cite>Prince of Cond&eacute;</cite>, or the Great Cond&eacute;.
The Spaniards had a superiority of numbers: the two
armies engaged near <cite>Roucroy</cite>, on the 19th of May, when
the French gained a decisive victory, and captured the
cannon, baggage, and many of the standards and colours
belonging to the Spaniards. Rutherford's Scots' Regiment
had the honor of taking part in this battle. It was
soon afterwards employed in the siege of <cite>Thionville</cite>, a
town situated on the river Moselle; and had one captain
and four men killed, and one major and several
private men wounded in the attack of the counterscarp.
This siege being prosecuted with vigour, the
town surrendered on the 10th of August, and the regiment
appears to have marched immediately afterwards
for Italy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> had been removed
from the Netherlands and placed under the orders of
Prince Francis-Thomas of Savoy, who commanded the
French army in Italy; and, having been engaged in
several operations, it was employed in the autumn in the
siege of the city of <cite>Turin</cite>, in Piedmont, which place was
invested on the 14th of August. The Scots Regiment
of Guards also arrived in Piedmont in time to take part
in the siege, which was terminated on the 27th of Sep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>tember
by the surrender of the city, when <span class="smcap">Douglas'
Regiment</span> was placed in garrison.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1644</div>

<p>Before the following campaign the regiment was,
however, removed from Piedmont to Picardy; and passing
from thence to the Netherlands, it served, in 1644,
under the Duke of Orleans, who held, during the minority
of Louis XIV., the title of Lieutenant-General to the
King. The army in the Netherlands was this year of
considerable magnitude, and <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> formed
part of the division commanded by Marshal Meilleraie,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and was engaged in the siege of <cite>Gravelines</cite>, a town
situated on the river Aa, nine miles from Dunkirk.
The communication of Gravelines with the sea rendered
it a place of great importance to the Spaniards, who made
strenuous exertions for its preservation. Two sorties
were made by the garrison in the early part of July,
when <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> was sharply engaged, and
the enemy was repulsed. Every attempt made by the
Spaniards to relieve the place was defeated, and the town
surrendered on the 28th of July, 1644. This success
was followed by the capture of several forts, and places
of minor importance, near the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1645</div>

<div class="sidenote">1646</div>

<p>While the Scots regiments in the service of France
were gaining laurels in Italy and Flanders, England continued
the theatre of civil war, and many desperate engagements
were fought with varied success. At length
the King's army, after suffering a series of reverses, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>found unable to withstand the forces of the Parliament;
and a number of officers and soldiers, who had fought in
the royal cause, fled to France, and were taken into the
service of Louis XIV. Five English battalions were
formed, and added to the French army in Flanders; and,
during the campaign of 1646, the British troops were
employed in the siege and capture of <cite>Courtray</cite>, a considerable
town on the river Lys; and they afterwards
took a distinguished part in the siege of the city of <cite>Dunkirk</cite>,
which surrendered to the French army on the 10th
of October, 1646.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1647</div>

<p>The British troops continued to take part in the war
in Flanders: and in 1648 a troop of Scots cuirassiers,
and the regiment of Scots Guards, had an opportunity
of distinguishing themselves at the battle of <cite>Lens</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in
Artois, under that distinguished commander the Prince
of Cond&eacute;. This battle was fought on the 10th of August,
1648. The Spanish army, commanded by Archduke
Leopold, suffered a complete overthrow, and lost thirty-eight
pieces of cannon, and upwards of one hundred
standards and colours.</p>

<p>Soon after this victory an insurrection broke out in
Paris; the court removed to Rouel, and afterwards to
St. Germain, and part of the army was recalled from
Flanders to besiege the capital, and to reduce the Parliament
of Paris to obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1648</div>

<div class="sidenote">1649</div>

<p>In this year (1648) a treaty was concluded at <cite>Munster</cite>,
which restored peace to a great part of Europe, but the war
was continued between France and Spain, and the British
troops were continued in the service of France. Mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>while
King Charles I. of England, having fallen into the
power of Cromwell, was beheaded at Whitehall Palace
on the 30th of January, 1649.</p>

<p>While these events were taking place in other parts of
Europe, Paris was besieged by the French army, of which
<span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> continued to form a part; but an
amicable arrangement between the Court and Parliament
took place in the spring of 1649. This was, however,
followed by insurrections in several of the provinces, and
the Spanish commanders, availing themselves of the distracted
state of France, recaptured several places in the
Netherlands.</p>

<p>While France was disturbed with internal commotions,
three hundred veteran Scots, who had been left in garrison
at <cite>Ypres</cite> in West Flanders, were engaged in the
defence of that place against the Spaniards, and, after a
gallant resistance, were eventually forced to surrender:
but obtained honourable conditions, and marched out on
the 6th of May, 1649, with drums beating and colours
flying.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1650</div>

<p>The commotions in France occasioned a decrease in
the revenues of Louis XIV., and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> veterans,
with the other Scots regiments in the French service,
could not procure their pay. Meanwhile, King Charles
II., who had been an exile on the continent for some
time, was entering into a treaty, called the <span class="smcap">Covenant</span>, with
the Scots, through whose means his Majesty expected to
recover the sovereignty of Great Britain; at the same
time, application was made to the French court for permission
for <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and the other regiments to return
to Scotland with the King; but these gallant veterans
were so beloved and esteemed in France for their good
conduct on all occasions, that Louis XIV. declined to
accede to this request, and promised to give them their
pay with greater regularity in future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1651</div>

<p>Had these distinguished regiments accompanied their
sovereign to Scotland, great advantage would, doubtless,
have accrued to the royal cause. But, instead of accompanying
their King, they were employed in the
defence of several strong towns on the frontiers of
Picardy and Flanders. The internal disorders in France
continued, a want of money prevailed in the army, and
many of the French soldiers deserted. At the same time
the Spaniards, being in communication with the disaffected
in France, recovered several more of the towns
which had been wrested from them in the preceding
campaigns, and besieged Dunkirk.</p>

<p>While these events were occurring on the continent,
Charles II. was crowned King in Scotland; but his
affairs not prospering in the north, he penetrated into
England, and the Scots troops sustained a decisive overthrow
at <cite>Worcester</cite> on the 3rd of September, 1651. The
King fled from the field, and, after remaining in concealment
with several loyal families for a short time, he
escaped in disguise to France.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the troubles in France were increasing.
The Duke of Orleans and the Prince of Cond&eacute; were
opposed to the court; the latter was at the head of an
army; and <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span> was employed in operations
against the insurgents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1652</div>

<p>After several marches and man&#339;uvres, the opposing
armies came in contact in the summer of 1652, in the
vicinity of <cite>Paris</cite>; the royal army was commanded by
Marshal Turenne; and the rebel army by the Prince of
Cond&eacute;, who erected barricades in the Fauxbourg of St.
Antoine, where he was attacked on the 2nd of July,
1652.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The fighting had been continued for some time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>with great resolution on both sides, when <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and
three other regiments attacked a barricade across one of
the streets near the river, which they carried sword in
hand, and, having dislodged the enemy from the houses,
established themselves on this spot. Immediately afterwards
a troop of royal horse, attempting to pass the
barricade, was repulsed by the insurgent horsemen, who
were driven back in their turn by the fire of <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
and another regiment from the houses. Scarcely had
the horse quitted the street, when two bodies of insurgent
foot came rushing forward with great fury to retake the
barricade, but <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and another regiment opened so
destructive a fire from the houses, and the regiments
which guarded the barricade made so resolute a defence,
that the rebels were repulsed with great loss. A general
attack was afterwards made on the other posts occupied
by the rebels in the suburbs of Paris, and the rebellion
would probably have been crushed at once, but the
Parisians opened their gates and admitted the insurgents
into the city, and thus protected them from the fury of
the royal army. The city of Paris having thus manifested
a determination to take part with the insurgents,
<span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment, with the remainder of the royal
army, retreated on the same day to St. Denis, where his
Majesty and the court had retired.</p>

<p>While the Prince of Cond&eacute; held possession of Paris,
and the royal army lay at St. Denis, a large Spanish army
prepared to penetrate from the Netherlands into France,
to act in concert with the French insurgents; when the
court of Louis XIV. removed to Pontoise, and the army
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>marched to Compeigne, and encamped under the walls
of the town. The Spanish army entered France, but after
a short stay it retired to the Netherlands, when the army
of Louis XIV. advanced towards Paris, and encamped
near Gonesse. This movement was followed by the
return of the Spanish forces under the Duke of Lorraine,
when the army under Marshal Turenne attempted
to intercept the enemy, and a sharp skirmish occurred at
<cite>Villeneuve St. Georges</cite>, nine miles from Paris, and the
designs of the Duke of Lorraine were frustrated. But
the Prince of Cond&eacute; marched out of Paris, and succeeded
in forming a junction with the Spaniards at Ablon; and
the united armies were double the number of the forces
under Marshal Turenne, who constructed two temporary
bridges over the Seine, threw up entrenchments, and
maintained his post for several weeks. While the two
armies confronted each other, frequent skirmishes occurred
in the fields and vineyards, in which <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Scots took
a conspicuous part. On one of these occasions a captain
of the regiment was taken prisoner, who escaped from
the enemy a few days afterwards, and brought information
that the Prince of Cond&eacute; had left the Spanish army
in consequence of indisposition. The enemy not being
so watchful as before, and the King's army being in
want of provisions, it retired with great secrecy during
the night of the 4th of October, and continued its march
to Courteuil, when the enemy quitted the vicinity of
Paris, and marched into winter quarters in Champagne
and other parts of France.</p>

<p>When the absence of the united rebel and Spanish
army from Paris was ascertained, the royal family of
France proceeded with a strong guard to the capital, and
obtained possession of the city; and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
with the remainder of the King's army, marched for
Champagne, to attack the enemy in his quarters.</p>

<p>During the winter <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment was engaged in
the siege of <cite>Bar le Duc</cite>; the lower town was taken by
storm, and, about the middle of December, when two
practicable breaches were made, the upper town and
castle surrendered; when an Irish regiment in the Spanish
service was made prisoners. The Irish finding that the
Duke of York was with the French army, in command
of the Scots gendarmes and a regiment of foot called the
Regiment of York, they obtained permission to enter the
French service, and were incorporated into the Duke's
regiment.</p>

<p>From Bar le Duc, <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment marched a
distance of nine miles, to <cite>Ligny</cite>, a town situate on the
river Ornain, and was engaged in the siege of the castle.
A mine being ready, on the 21st of December, "Marshal
Turenne commanded the regiments of York and
<span class="smcap">Douglas</span> to prepare for the attack at the springing of
the mine, and ordered his own regiment to be in readiness
to second them. All things being prepared in
this manner, fire was given to the mine, and in the
midst of the smoke, before it could be discerned what
effect the mine had produced, the Count d'Estr&eacute;es,
who commanded the attack, ordered it to be instantly
made. Accordingly, they fell on, passing over the
ditch, which was very broad, upon the ice. But when
they came to the ditch, they perceived that the mine
had failed their expectation, and there was no possibility
of mounting the breach. Upon this there was a
necessity of making a retreat; the ice broke under the
men, and most of them fell into the ditch, which gave
leisure to the enemy to do execution on them. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
for want of a little patience to see what effect the mine
had wrought; the regiment of York lost four captains,
some lieutenants and ensigns, and about a hundred
men, slain outright, and the regiment of <span class="smcap">Douglas</span> two
captains and near fifty private soldiers; besides many
officers and soldiers hurt."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Immediately after this
failure another mine was commenced, and the garrison
surrendered on the 22nd of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1653</div>

<p>A garrison having been placed in Ligny, the army
proceeded to <cite>Ch&acirc;teau Portien</cite>, a small town of the Ardennes,
situate on the right bank of the river Aisne; and
while on this march the weather was so severe, that
several of the soldiers were frozen to death on the road.
The siege of this place was commenced in the beginning
of January, 1653, and the town was delivered up in less
than ten days.</p>

<p>Having completed this conquest, the troops proceeded
through a difficult tract of country, and besieged <cite>Vervins</cite>.
The weather continued inclement, the men were suffering
from the want of food, and great difficulties had to be
overcome; yet the attacks were made with such spirit
and determination, that possession was gained of this
town on the 28th of January.</p>

<p>The troops were now exhausted, and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment
was sent into quarters of refreshment. It again
took the field in June following; but the enemy had so
great a superiority of numbers, that the greater part of
the year was passed in defensive operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1654</div>

<div class="sidenote">1655</div>

<p>The regiment appears to have passed the year 1654 in
garrison. In 1655 it was employed in the Netherlands;
its Colonel, Lieutenant-General Lord James Douglas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
commanded a flying camp between Douay and Arras;
several skirmishes occurred, and on one occasion <span class="smcap">Lord
James Douglas</span> was killed; he was succeeded in
the Colonelcy by his brother, <span class="smcap">Lord George Douglas</span>,
afterwards <span class="smcap">Earl of Dumbarton</span>. This change in its
Colonel did not alter the title of the corps, as it continued
to be distinguished by the title of <span class="smcap">Douglas' Regiment</span>.</p>

<p>This year (1655) the King of France concluded a
treaty with Cromwell, who was at the head of the British
nation with the title of Lord Protector; and it was
stipulated that a body of Cromwell's forces should proceed
to Flanders to co-operate with the French against
the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1656</div>

<div class="sidenote">1657</div>

<div class="sidenote">1658</div>

<p>This treaty occasioned King Charles II. to unite his
interests with those of Spain; the Duke of York quitted
France, and obtained a command in the Spanish army;
and a great part of the Royal British troops, which had
escaped from England and entered the French army,
transferred their services from the crown of France to
that of Spain. The cavalier gentlemen, who thus transferred
their services to the crown of Spain, were formed
into a troop of Horse Guards, of which Charles Berkeley
(afterwards Earl of Falmouth) was appointed Captain
and Colonel; and the remainder were formed into six
regiments of foot&mdash;one English, one Scots, and four
Irish.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The determination thus manifested, by the
British troops in the service of France to preserve their
loyalty to King Charles II., appears to have occasioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>measures to be adopted by the French commanders to
prevent <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>, and the other old Scots regiments,
from following this example; and these corps appear to
have been placed in remote garrisons, as they are not
mentioned in the histories of the military transactions in
the Netherlands in 1657 and 1658, in which years the
French army and Cromwell's forces captured St. Venant
and Mardyk, defeated the Spanish army, and afterwards
took Dunkirk, Ypres, Bruges, Dixmude, Furnes, Gravelines,
Oudenarde, and Menin; and Dunkirk was occupied
by the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1659</div>

<p>In September, 1658, Cromwell died; and in 1659 the
Prince of Cond&eacute; disbanded his forces, and having tendered
his submission to the crown of France, he was
received into the favour of Louis XIV. At the same
time a treaty of peace, called the Peace of the Pyrenees,
was concluded between France and Spain, and Dunkirk
was ceded to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1660</div>

<p>After this treaty was concluded the strength of the
French army was decreased, and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment
was reduced to eight companies. These events were
followed by the restoration of King Charles II. to the
throne of Great Britain; when the British troops which
had been in the service of Spain were placed in garrison
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>at Dunkirk; and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment, in the French
service, was in garrison at Avennes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1661</div>

<p>Soon after the restoration, King Charles II. disbanded
the army of the Commonwealth, which he found in
England at his return. It was, however, deemed necessary
to have a regular force established, for in January,
1661, a number of religious fanatics, called millenarians,
or fifth monarchy-men, took arms against the government,
and, although this insurrection was suppressed in
a few days, yet it was deemed necessary to send for the
Duke of York's troop of Guards from Dunkirk, and
afterwards for <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> veteran Scots regiment from
Flanders.</p>

<p>The regiment having arrived in England in the spring
of 1661, it obtained rank in the British army from that
date. It appears, however, to have had rank in the
Swedish army from about the year 1625, and in the
French army from 1633. No instance has been met
with of its having been distinguished by any other title
than the name of its Colonel, except during part of
the time it was in the Swedish service, when it was designated,
together with three other Scots regiments of
which it is now the representative, the <span class="smcap">Green Brigade</span>.</p>

<p>Soon after its arrival in England the establishment of
the regiment was augmented, and its presence at this
particular period was of great service to King Charles II.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
But his Majesty having (after disbanding the whole of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>the army of the Commonwealth) established three troops
of Life Guards, a regiment of Horse Guards, and two
regiments of Foot Guards, in England; and a troop of
Life Guards, and a regiment of Foot Guards in Scotland;
it was not deemed necessary to detain <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
veteran corps in England, and it was, accordingly, sent
back to France in 1662.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1662</div>

<p>At the same time, General Andrew Rutherford, who
commanded the battalion of Scots Guards in the French
service, having been appointed Governor of Dunkirk by
King Charles II., his battalion was incorporated in
<span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment. There was also another battalion
of Scots Foot in the service of France, commanded by
Lord James Douglas, and this battalion was likewise incorporated
into <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> veteran regiment, which now
consisted of twenty-three companies of one hundred men
each, and its established numbers, including officers and
non-commissioned officers, were upwards of 2500.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1663</div>

<p>The King of France having, after the treaty of the
Pyrenees, placed his army upon a peace establishment,
the strength of <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment was reduced to eight
companies of one hundred men each.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1665</div>

<div class="sidenote">1666</div>

<p>Three years after its return to France, a war broke
out between England and Holland; and in the succeeding
year Louis XIV. took part with the Dutch against
England, when <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> regiment was again ordered to
quit the French service, and to return to England: it accordingly
landed at Rye, in Sussex, on the 12th of
June, 1666, and mustered eight hundred men.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The Roman Catholics in several counties in Ireland
were, at this period, in a state of insurrection; and in a
short time after the arrival of the regiment from France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
it was ordered to proceed to Ireland, where it appears to
have remained upwards of twelve months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1668</div>

<div class="sidenote">1670</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the peace of Breda in 1668,
the insurrections in Ireland having been suppressed, the
regiment was again sent to France; and in an order
issued by Louis XIV. in 1670, respecting the rank of
regiments, it appears one of the first.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1672</div>

<p>A war commenced in 1672 between the French monarch
and the States General of Holland; King Charles II.
of England also declared war against the Dutch;
and a British force, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth,
was sent to France to co-operate with the army
of Louis XIV. in an attack upon Holland. <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
Regiment had, in the meantime, been augmented to
sixteen companies, and when the army took the field, it
formed two battalions; and was in the division of the
army commanded by Marshal Turenne. Several fortified
towns were captured by the main army; and in June,
<span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment, being encamped in the vicinity of
Nimeguen, was detached with several other corps under
the Comte de Chamilly to besiege <cite>Grave</cite>. The attack
on the town commenced towards the end of June, and in
the early part of July the governor surrendered. A
number of the subjects of the British crown, who had
entered the service of Holland, being found in garrison,
they were permitted to engage in the service of Louis
XIV., and were received as recruits in <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
In August the regiment was withdrawn from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>the vicinity of Grave, and ordered to join the forces under
Marshal Turenne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1673</div>

<p>In 1673 eight thousand British troops served with the
French army, and were engaged in the siege of <cite>Maestricht</cite>,
in which service they evinced signal gallantly;
and in repulsing a sally of part of the garrison, the Duke
of Monmouth, Captain Churchill (afterwards the great
Duke of Marlborough), and twelve private men of the
English Life Guards (a squadron of which corps was
serving with the French army), highly distinguished
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The town surrendered on the 2nd of July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1674</div>

<p>Before the following year King Charles II. concluded
a treaty of peace with the Dutch Republic; but his
Majesty did not withdraw the whole of his troops from
France; and during the campaign of 1674 <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
Regiment, with the Scots regiment of Hamilton, and
the English regiments of Monmouth and Churchill,
served with the French army on the Rhine, commanded
by Marshal Turenne. In the early part of June, <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
Regiment was encamped near Philipsburg,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a town in
the west of Germany about half a mile from the Rhine,
and was formed in brigade with the French regiments of
Plessis and La Fert&eacute;, with a battalion of detachments,
commanded by Brigadier-General the Marquis of Douglas.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The opposing armies having taken the field, <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
Regiment was suddenly withdrawn from the vicinity of
Philipsburg, and, after crossing the Rhine, advanced
towards the ancient city of <cite>Heidelberg</cite>, to prevent the
junction of the forces under the Duke of Lorraine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>the army commanded by the Duke of Bournonville.
This movement brought on several skirmishes, in which
the regiment took part; it was also engaged in a sharp
action on the 16th of June, when the Imperialists were
defeated; and in the accounts of this action published at
the time, the conduct of the regiment is spoken of in
terms of commendation.</p>

<p>After chasing the enemy out of the Palatinate, the
regiment retired with the army across the Rhine, to join
the reinforcements from Alsace and other places; and
after the arrival of these troops, the army re-passed the
Rhine, and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and two other regiments were detached
to the vicinity of Landau, and ordered to encamp
within a league of the town. The regiment was subsequently
detached towards Manheim, and, after taking
part in several operations, in the beginning of October it
was encamped at Lavantzenaw, in Alsace.</p>

<p>Information having been received that the Germans
had passed the Rhine and advanced to <cite>Molsheim</cite>, the
French and British troops quitted their camp about an
hour after midnight on the 3rd of October, and after a
march of several hours, arrived at the enemy's camp, and
attacked them with great spirit. The conflict took place
amongst woods and broken grounds, and the British
troops displayed signal gallantry, fighting with a spirit
and resolution which the enemy could not withstand.
Many officers and men fell, yet the conflict was continued,
and Lord Duras (afterwards Earl of Feversham)
had three horses killed under him. Eventually the
enemy were driven from the field, with the loss of ten
pieces of cannon, thirty standards and colours, and several
prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans were subsequently reinforced by a
number of fresh troops, when Marshal Turenne retired
with the French and British forces, and took up a position
near Saverne in Alsace, by which he prevented the
Imperialists deriving much advantage from their superiority
of numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1675</div>

<p>During the depth of the winter, when the Germans
had retreated, <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> was placed, with
several other corps, under the orders of the Marquis of
Vaubrun, and engaged in the siege of <cite>Dachstein</cite>, a town
in the department of the Lower Rhine. The trenches
were opened during the night of the 25th of January,
1675; and during the night of the 28th, <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span>
veterans were engaged in storming the works, and lost
several officers and men. Amongst the killed was the
Major of the regiment, who is stated by the French historians
to have been an officer of great merit. On the
following day the governor surrendered the town, when
the regiment was sent into quarters.</p>

<p>It again took the field in the month of May, and was
encamped for a short time near Strasburg; at the same
time the Germans, under the Count de Montecuculi,
menaced the city of Philipsburg with a siege; but the
French and British forces passed the Rhine on the 7th of
June, when the Germans changed their position, and the
two armies confronted each other, and man&#339;uvred for
several days in the territory bordering on the Rhine.
<span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment, having been on a detached service
for some time, was suddenly ordered to join the main
army, from whence it was afterwards sent to <cite>Treves</cite> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
reinforce the garrison. Several sharp skirmishes occurred;
and on the 27th of July, as Marshal Turenne was reconnoitring
the enemy, he was killed by a cannon-ball. After
the death of this celebrated veteran, the army was commanded
<em>ad interim</em> by the Count de Lorge, who retreated
across the <em>Rhine</em>. The Germans attacked their adversaries
while making this retrograde movement, when the gallant
conduct of two battalions of veteran Scots saved the main
army from a severe loss. <em>Treves</em> was afterwards besieged
by the Germans, and <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Regiment highly distinguished
itself in the defence of this ancient city, under the
command of Marshal de Crequi. The French troops
mutinied, and endeavoured to compel the governor to surrender,
but <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> Scots stood by the Marshal in the
desperate defence of the town, and were thanked for their
conduct by Louis XIV. Treves was surrendered on the
5th of September, and the regiment was bound by the
articles not to serve for three months, either in the field
or in the defence of any town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1676</div>

<p>The French monarch having employed the greater
part of his forces in making conquests in the Netherlands,
a small army, of which <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and Hamilton's Scots
regiments formed part, was employed on the Rhine during
the campaign of 1676, under the orders of Marshal
Luxembourg. The imperial army, commanded by the
Duke of Lorraine, had great superiority of numbers. In
the beginning of June, the two armies were man&#339;uvring
and skirmishing in Alsace; and on the 5th of that month,
while the French were retiring through the mountains
near <em>Saverne</em>, the Germans attacked the rear-guard with
great fury, and, having forced a defile, put several French
squadrons into confusion. But as the German horsemen
galloped between the mountains in pursuit, two battalions
of Scots foot having taken post on some high ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
beyond the defile, the musketeers opened so tremendous a
fire that the pursuing squadrons were checked and forced
to retire, when a regiment of German horse, and several
squadrons of Lorraine dragoons, were nearly destroyed.
In this rencontre Sir George Hamilton and several other
officers of distinction were killed. The French army
subsequently formed an entrenched camp near Saverne;
and the Germans besieged Philipsburg, which was surrendered
on the 15th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1677</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1677, the French army on
the Rhine was commanded by Marshal de Crequi. The
British troops with this army consisted this year of two
squadrons of Royal English horse, and two battalions
of <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> and a battalion of Monmouth's regiments.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The opposing armies took the field, and after much
man&#339;uvring and skirmishing, the Prince of Saxe-Eysenach,
who commanded a division of Germans, having
been driven into an island on the Rhine, was forced
to capitulate. A sharp skirmish afterwards took place
at <em>Kochersberg</em>, in Alsace, when the Imperialists were
defeated, and sustained great loss. <em>Fribourg</em> was subsequently
besieged by a detachment from the French army,
and the garrison surrendered on the 16th of November,
when <span class="smcap">Douglas'</span> regiment proceeded into winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1678</div>

<p>At length the conquests effected by France occasioned
the English Court and Parliament to become sensible of
the necessity of restraining the ambition of Louis XIV.;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
and King Charles II., having concluded a treaty with the
Dutch, gave orders for the British troops in the French
service to return to England; at the same time, his
Majesty issued commissions for an augmentation of about
twenty thousand men to the English army, and declared
his determination of engaging in the war with France.
<span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment, as it was now designated,
accordingly received orders in the early part of the year
1678 to quit the service of the French monarch, and
from this period it has been permanently on the British
establishment.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the regiment from France, a
number of men, who each carried a large pouch filled
with <span class="smcap">Hand-Grenades</span>, were added to the establishment,
and formed into a company, under the command of Captain
Robert Hodges. These men were instructed to ignite
the fuses, and to cast the grenades into forts, trenches,
or amidst the ranks of their enemies, where the explosion
was calculated to produce much execution; and the men,
deriving their designation from the combustibles with
which they were armed, were styled <span class="smcap">Grenadiers</span>. Their
duties were considered more arduous than those of the
pikemen or musketeers; and the strongest and most
active men were selected for the grenadier company.
And although the hand-grenades have long been laid
aside, yet one company, which is designated the "Grenadier
Company," continues to form part of every battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1679</div>

<p>In 1679, <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment, which consisted at
this period of twenty-one companies, was stationed in
Ireland. In the autumn of this year, Tangier, in Africa
(which had been ceded by Portugal to Charles II., in
1662, as part of the marriage-portion of his consort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Donna Catherina, Infanta of Portugal), was besieged by
the Moors, who destroyed two forts at a short distance
from the town, and then retired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1680</div>

<p>They, however, again appeared before the town in the
spring of 1680, when four companies of <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span>
Regiment were ordered to reinforce the garrison; and
these companies having embarked at Kinsale in the
James and Swan frigates, landed at Tangier on the 4th
of April.</p>

<p>Fort Henrietta, which stood at a short distance from
the town, was at this time besieged by the Moors, and
two breaches having been made, and the works undermined,
the garrison could not maintain the place; consequently
a sally from the city was resolved upon, to
give the garrison an opportunity of blowing up the fort,
and of cutting their passage through the Moorish army
to the town; and Captain Hume, Lieutenant Pierson,
Lieutenant Bayley, four serjeants, and 80 private men, of
<span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment, were selected to form the forlorn-hope
in the sally. Accordingly, at eight o'clock on
the morning of the 12th of May, <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> veterans
issued from the town, and made a gallant attack on the
Moorish army; at the same time the garrison in the fort
blew up the building, and rushed forward, sword in
hand, to cut their passage through the barbarians. The
conflict was sharp: the Moors came running forward in
crowds to cut off this devoted band; yet these resolute
Britons forced the first trench, and gained the second.
This was, however, twelve feet deep; and while struggling
to overcome the difficulty, Captain Trelawny and
120 men were killed by the Moors; and only forty-four
officers and men succeeded in joining Captain Hume and
his party of veteran Scots. This party was also attacked
by several bodies of Moorish horsemen, who were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
expert lancers; but the barbarians were repulsed. One
Moorish chieftain rode over Captain Hume; but his
horse fell, and the barbarian was immediately killed.
The men continued skirmishing, and retiring in good
order until they arrived under the protection of the guns
of the fortress. The companies of <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment
lost on this occasion fifteen men killed, and Captain
Hume<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and several men wounded.</p>

<p>In a few days after this action a cessation of hostilities
was agreed upon with the Moors for four months; and
during the summer twelve additional companies of
<span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment arrived at Tangier, from Ireland,
under the command of Major Sir James Hackett.
The arrival of these celebrated veterans is thus announced
in one of the publications of that period:&mdash;"After this
landed the valorous Major Hackett with the renowned
regiment of the Earl of Dumbarton; all of them men
of approved valour, fame having echoed the sound of
their glorious actions and achievements in France and
other nations; having left behind them a report of
their glorious victories wherever they came; every place
witnessing and giving large testimony of their renown:
so that the arrival of this illustrious regiment more and
more increased the resolutions and united the courage
of the inhabitants, and added confidence to their
valour."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>Hostilities again commenced in September, when the
garrison quitted the town, and encamped under the walls;
and the Lieut.-Governor, Sir Palmes Fairborne, is
reported to have made the following speech to <span class="smcap">Dumbarton</span>'s
Scots:&mdash;"Countrymen and fellow-soldiers, let not
your approved valour and fame in foreign nations be
derogated at this time, neither degenerate from your
ancient and former glory abroad; and as you are looked
upon here to be brave and experienced soldiers (constant
and successive victories having attended your conquering
swords hitherto), do not come short of the
great hopes we have in you, and the propitious procedures
we expect from you at this time. For the glory
of your nation, if you cannot surpass, you may imitate
the bravest, and be emulous of their praises and
renown."<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The expectations of the Lieutenant-Governor, with
regard to these celebrated Scots, appear to have been
realised; and in the various skirmishes and actions which
followed, they always signalised themselves. In the
account of a sharp action fought on the 20th of September,
it is reported that "The grenadiers under
Captain Hodges behaved themselves very bravely."
On the 22nd of the same month, "Some of the Moorish
horse advanced resolutely to the very line where our
men were lodged, but were repulsed, and several of
them killed. Several of the Scots grenadiers, who were
very active and daring, advancing a little too far,
were killed, and others, advancing to their relief, were
likewise hard put to it." A sharp skirmish was afterwards
kept up throughout the day, and "The Scots and
the seamen from the fleet were hotly engaged, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
beat the Moors out of several trenches." While retiring,
Captain Fitzpatrick was attacked by a Moorish
chieftain, but was delivered by a shot which brought the
barbarian down at the moment he was about to spear the
captain. A Scots grenadier, of undaunted bravery,
being desirous of possessing the Moor's charger, leaped
over the trenches and seized the horse; but this brave
man was immediately afterwards cut to pieces by a party
of Moors, who came galloping forward at the moment he
was about to retire with the horse. On the same day it
was resolved, in consequence of a newly-erected fort being
completed, to retire within the walls, when Sir James
Hackett, at the head of <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Scots, covered the
retrograde movement, and repulsed several charges made
by the Moorish lancers.</p>

<p>A sally was made from the town on the 24th of September,
when the Scots again distinguished themselves,
and had Captain Forbes and eight men killed. The
Lieut.-Governor, Sir Palmes Fairborne, also received a
mortal wound, and was succeeded in the command of the
garrison by Lieut.-Colonel Sackville of the Foot Guards.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September, a general sally of the garrison
was made on the Moorish lines, where between
fourteen and fifteen thousand barbarians were encamped.
About three in the morning, the troops issued in silence
from the town, and formed in order of battle. Soon afterwards
the signal for the attack was given, when <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span><a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
company of Scots grenadiers, led by Captain
Hodges, and followed by the remaining companies of the
regiment, rushed towards the Moorish lines with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>velocity of lightning. The Moors, who were reposing
beyond their trenches, were suddenly aroused by the
sound of a trampling multitude rushing to battle; and
the next moment a shower of hand-grenades bursting
amongst them put them in some confusion; yet they
sprang to their arms, and, standing firm to receive the
charge, disputed the ground with firmness. Soon the
action became general, and "Nothing was heard but the
roaring of cannon, the firing of muskets, and the loud
acclamations of the Christians, who, ever and anon, when
they gained any trench of the enemy, raised a shout
which pierced the clouds, and echoed in the sky.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>"
<span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> veterans quickly carried the first trench,
then mixing in fierce combat with the Moors, soon proved
that a valiant Scot was more than a match for one of the
dusky sons of Africa. The first trench having been won,
a portion of it was levelled for the cavalry, and the British
and Spanish horsemen charged the Moors, and plunging
amidst the dark masses, trampled and cut down the
astonished Africans. At the same time the British grenadiers
were seen using their hatchets with dreadful execution
on one side, the pikemen were bearing down all
before them on another, and, the musketeers, having slung
their muskets, were fighting, sword in hand, with an impetuosity
which the Moors could not withstand. The
waving masses of barbarians were broken, and they
fled like a scattered swarm over the land; the British
troops pursued, and a number of single combats followed,
for the Moors were more expert in personal conflicts than
in fighting in large bodies. These combats, however,
generally terminated in favour of the British; and the
Scots, particularly Captain Hodges and his grenadier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>company, were distinguished for the number they slew.
Thus the siege of Tangier was raised, and <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span>
veteran Scots captured a splendid colour<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> from the
Moors. The regiment lost<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in this action, Lieutenants
Scott and St. Leger; Ensigns Farrell, Murray, Bell, and
Rhue; six serjeants, and thirty private soldiers killed;
Captains Lockart, Lundy, Hume, Douglas, and Percy;
Lieutenants Glascock, Murray, Ennis, Corson, Bainesman,
Macrohen, Stuart, Aukmooty, and Butler; with
Ensign Mowast, and one hundred serjeants and private
men wounded.</p>

<p>In a few days after this engagement a truce was concluded
with the Moors for six months; and in the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>part of December a regiment of foot (now the Fourth, or
King's own), with 200 recruits for <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment,
arrived from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1681</div>

<p>During the winter, Lieut.-Colonel Kirk was sent on
an embassy to Muley-Ismael, Emperor of Morocco. In
the spring of 1681, a treaty of peace for four years was
concluded and sent to England by Captain Thomas
Langston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1682</div>

<div class="sidenote">1683</div>

<p>King Charles II., however, found the maintenance of
a sufficient garrison at Tangier too expensive to be continued
without the aid of a grant from parliament. At
the same time the nation was more alarmed at the prospect
of a popish successor to the throne than at the
apprehension of losing this fortress, which they feared
would become a nursery for popish soldiers. The advantage
derived from the Levant trade, and other arguments,
were brought forward in favour of maintaining Tangier;
but the parliament refused the necessary supply; and
towards the end of 1683, Admiral Lord Dartmouth was
sent with a fleet to demolish the fortress, and to bring
away the garrison and British inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1684</div>

<p>One company of <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment arrived from
Tangier, in November, 1683, and landed at Gravesend;
and the remainder arrived in the river Thames in February,
1684, and, having landed at Rochester, were
quartered&mdash;eight companies at Rochester and Chatham,
six at Winchester, and two at Southampton. At the
same time directions were sent to the Duke of Ormond,
the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, to send the five companies
of the regiment in that country to England.</p>

<p>In June of this year four companies attended the
Duchess of York (afterwards Queen of England) at
Tunbridge Wells; and in the autumn King Charles II.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
conferred upon this celebrated regiment the title of <span class="smcap">The
Royal Regiment of Foot</span>.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of October, sixteen companies of the Royal
Regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Sir James
Hackett, were reviewed, with a number of other corps,
by King Charles II., on Putney Heath. "The Coldstream,
my Lord <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span>, and the Admiral's
Battalions, successively exercised all three by beat of
drum, the military postures of pike, sword, and musket,
every man dexterously discharging his duties with an
exact and general readiness, to the great delight of
their Majesties and Royal Highnesses, who vouchsafed,
all the time of exercise, to grace the arms with their
presence. The other two battalions of the Royal Regiment<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
had not fallen short of the like performance, if
illness of weather, when they just intended it, had not
prevented: the day proving wet and showery was a general
impediment from proceeding at that time to any
other motions customary upon the like reviews; and all
decamped sooner than otherwise they would have done."
In the Army List, published by Nathan Brooks, in
October, 1684, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>, or <span class="smcap">Dumbarton's</span> Regiment, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>stated to "consist of twenty-one companies, two lieutenants
to each company, three serjeants, three corporals,
and two drums, established; distinguished by red coats
lined with white; sashes white, with a white fringe;
breeches and stockings light grey; grenadiers distinguished
by caps lined white, the lion's face, proper,
crowned; flys St. Andrew's cross, with thistle and
crown, circumscribed in the centre, '<i lang="la">Nemo me impun&egrave;
lacessit</i>.'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p>After the review, the regiment was stationed in extensive
cantonments in the county of Kent, where it remained
until the death of King Charles II., on the 6th February,
1685, when it was suddenly ordered to march into
quarters in London and the adjacent villages.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Although
King James II. was known to be a papist, yet
no opposition was made to his accession to the throne;
and in March four companies proceeded to Yarmouth,
and four to Rochester, leaving thirteen companies in
quarters in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The tranquillity of the kingdom was, however, suddenly
disturbed in June, 1685, by the rebellion of James,
Duke of Monmouth, who appeared on the western coast
with a band of followers, and asserted his pretensions to
the throne, when orders were issued for the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
to be augmented to one hundred men per company,
and five companies were sent from London to Portsmouth,
to increase the strength of that garrison.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Brigadier-General Lord Churchill
(afterwards the Great Duke of Marlborough) was sent to
the west of England with a body of troops to oppose the
rebels; and another division of the army followed under
the direction of Lieut.-General the Earl of Feversham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
who was appointed to the command of the royal forces.
At the same time five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
of foot, under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald
Douglas, and a troop of the Royal Horse Guards,
commanded by Sir Francis Compton, were sent from
London with the train of artillery to be employed on
this service. The four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
at Yarmouth were at the same time ordered to
march to London; so that during Monmouth's rebellion
the regiment was employed as follows:&mdash;Five companies
with the army; five in garrison at Portsmouth; seven
attending the court in London; and four at Rochester.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, under the
orders of Lieut.-Colonel Douglas, with nine field-pieces,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
having joined the army under the Earl of Feversham,
the rebels found it necessary to move to Bridgewater.
The King's forces advanced to the village of Weston,
where they arrived on the 5th of July, and the cavalry
having been quartered in the village, the infantry encamped
on <em>Sedgemoor</em>. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, being formed in
one small battalion, took the right of the line, and were
posted behind a deep ditch; a squadron of horse and
fifty dragoons were sent forward as an advanced guard,
and one hundred of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were kept under arms in
readiness to support the cavalry out-guards. During
the night the rebels marched out of Bridgewater, with
the design of surprising the King's forces; but the guard
having given an alarm, the five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment were formed in order of battle in a few
moments, and opening their fire upon the advancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>rebels with good effect, held them in check, and gave
time to the other battalions to form, and for the cavalry
to draw out of the village.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The rebel cavalry, under
Lord Grey, first attempted to charge the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, but
being unable to cross the ditch, they were driven back by
the steady fire of the veteran Scots. The rebel infantry,
headed by the Duke of Monmouth, directing their march
by the fire, first attacked the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and extending
along the moor, a sharp combat of musketry ensued in
the dark. The rebel foot, consisting principally of
miners, fought with desperation; but their cavalry was
soon chased out of the field by the King's horsemen; and
when daylight appeared, the Life Guards, Royal Horse
Guards, and Royal Dragoons, charged the right flank of
the rebel infantry, and put Monmouth's untrained battalions
into disorder. A complete rout ensued; the insurgents
fled from the moor; and numbers were slain and made
prisoners in the adjoining fields. The companies of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment were foremost in the pursuit, and captured
the Duke of Monmouth's standard with his motto
in gold letters,&mdash;"<em>Fear none But God.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Monmouth was taken prisoner soon afterwards,
and was beheaded on the 15th of July on Tower-Hill,
London.</p>

<p>Thus the rebellion was suppressed; and the sum of
397<em>l.</em> was paid to the officers and soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment of foot who were wounded in this service, as
is set forth in the following warrant, copied from the
public accounts of that period:&mdash;</p>

<p>Serjeant Weems of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment particularly
distinguished himself; and a warrant of James II.
directs that he should be paid "Forty pounds for good
service in the action at Sedgemoor, in firing the great
guns against the rebels."</p>

<p>A few days after the battle, the establishment of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was reduced from 100 to 50 private
men per company; and in August eleven companies
were encamped on Hounslow Heath, where they were
reviewed by the King. In September, thirteen com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>panies
marched to Winchester, to attend the court at
that city; and the regiment passed the winter at Portsmouth
and Exeter, with one company detached to Lynn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>At this period the establishment of the regiment
consisted of 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 1 major,
18 captains, 1 captain-lieutenant, 41 lieutenants, 21
ensigns, 1 adjutant, 1 chaplain, 1 quarter-master and
marshal, 1 chirurgeon, 1 chirurgeon's mate, 1 drum-major,
1 piper, 42 drummers, 63 serjeants, 63 corporals,
and 1050 private soldiers. The privilege of
having two lieutenants and three serjeants to each company
appears to have been peculiar to this regiment; and
a warrant of King James II., dated the 1st of January,
1686, directs that "As any of the lieutenants of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment shall die, or be displaced, their
number be reduced to one lieutenant only in each
company of this regiment; and that as the serjeants
shall die, or be displaced, they be in the same manner
reduced to two in each company."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1686, a second adjutant and a
second surgeon's mate were added to the establishment,
and the regiment was again divided into two battalions;
the first battalion consisting of eleven, and the second of
ten companies; and in April the second battalion embarked
at Gravesend for Scotland. At the same time the
whole of the first battalion was placed in garrison at
Portsmouth, from whence it marched in June following
to the vicinity of Hounslow, and on the 24th of that
month erected its tents on the heath, where about twelve
thousand men were encamped, under the orders of Lieut.-Generals
the Earls of Feversham and Dumbarton, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
were frequently exercised in presence of the royal family.
In July, four companies marched from Hounslow Heath,
and encamped near Tunbridge Wells, to attend the
Princess Anne (afterwards Queen Anne) during her residence
at that place; and in August the battalion struck
its tents, and marched to Yarmouth and Bungay, with a
detachment at Landguard-Fort, where it passed the
winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1687</div>

<p>From these quarters the first battalion was removed in
the spring of 1637 to the vicinity of London, where it
halted a few days, and afterwards proceeded to Portsmouth,
and passed the summer months in that garrison.
In the autumn it marched into Yorkshire; and the men
were employed dining the winter in working on the fortifications
at Hull.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>In April, 1688, the first battalion was recalled from
Yorkshire, and was stationed at Greenwich, Woolwich,
and Deptford, until the 26th of June, when it encamped
on Hounslow Heath.</p>

<p>In the meantime the second battalion had marched
from Scotland to York. In August it proceeded to
Hertford and Ware; and in September to Gravesend,
where the first battalion had previously arrived from
Hounslow Heath; and the two battalions being again
united, occupied Gravesend, Tilbury-Fort, Sheerness,
and other places along the banks of the Thames and the
coast of Kent.</p>

<p>At this period the nation was violently agitated by
political events. The King, being a roman catholic,
and being guided by jesuitical councils, and countenanced
and encouraged by a few families of the same persuasion,
was attempting to effect the subversion of the established
religion and laws. At the same time many noblemen
and gentlemen who felt the greatest concern for the welfare
of their country had invited the Prince of Orange to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
come to England with a Dutch army to aid them in resisting
the proceedings of the court. Thus the kingdom
was divided against itself, and men were looking forward,
with a mixed feeling of hope, terror, and consternation,
to the great convulsion which threatened the State. The
King made preparations to avert the danger, and augmented
his army, when the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was increased
to 26 companies, and the total strength to 1858
officers and soldiers, each battalion having now a grenadier
company.</p>

<p>In the early part of November, the Dutch fleet having
sailed past Dover, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was ordered to
the west; and when the Prince of Orange had landed at
Torbay and advanced to Exeter, it proceeded to Warminster,
which was the most advanced post of the royal
army. The head-quarters were at Salisbury, and King
James reviewed his army on Salisbury Plain on the 21st
of November. But his Majesty found that his conduct
had alienated the affections not only of his subjects in
general, but of the officers and soldiers of his army, many
of whom forsook his camp and joined the Prince of
Orange. Yet, while many of the nobility and gentry,
with officers and soldiers from almost every regiment in
the army, were quitting the King's standard daily, the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment of Foot was an exception; it preserved
its ranks entire, and stood with an unshaken loyalty
amidst the general defection which prevailed in the kingdom.</p>

<p>When the King ordered his forces to retire towards
London, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment marched, first to Devizes,
and afterwards to Windsor, where it arrived on the 29th
of November. The desertions continuing, the King sent
orders to Lieut.-General the Earl of Feversham to make
no further resistance to the Prince of Orange, and his
Majesty afterwards attempted to effect his escape to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
France. These orders produced much confusion. Several
corps were disbanded; and the men spreading themselves
in parties over the country, committed many disorders.
The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, however, appears to have been
equally conspicuous for good order as for loyalty, and
continued at its post of duty until directed by the Prince
of Orange to march to Oxford.</p>

<p>Although the King failed in his first attempt to escape
to France, yet he afterwards succeeded, and having been
followed by the Earl of Dumbarton, the Colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, the Prince of Orange conferred the
Colonelcy on one of his most distinguished officers,
Marshal Frederick De Schomberg, afterwards Duke
Schomberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>After these events had transpired, a convention was
assembled, which declared the throne abdicated and
vacant, and conferred the sovereignty on William and
Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange. Many of the
officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment were, however,
not satisfied with the new arrangements. Their regiment
had been King James's favourite corps, on account of its
antiquity, valour, and good conduct, and its having served
with his Majesty in France, when he was an exile. Having
preserved their loyalty to the last, the officers and
men did not expect much favour from the new king. At
the same time they were not pleased that a foreigner,
Marshal Schomberg, though an officer of distinguished
merit, should be placed at the head of a national Scots
corps. While these feelings were prevalent in the breasts
of the officers and men, the regiment received orders to
embark for the Netherlands to replace the Dutch troops
which were in England. This order was considered premature:
the national assembly in Scotland had not
declared for King William, and the Scots officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
soldiers did not consider themselves bound to obey the
commands of a king who had not been acknowledged in
Scotland. Under this impression a number of officers
and men mutinied, and, seizing the money appointed for
their pay, marched with four pieces of cannon towards
Scotland. At the same time the Royal Regiment of Scots
Horse, commanded by Major-General Viscount Dundee,
deserted from its quarters at Abingdon, and proceeded in
the same direction.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The King sent Major-General Sir
John Lanier with his own (now the First Dragoon Guards),
and Colonel Langston's regiment of horse, and Lieut.-General
De Ginkell (afterwards Earl of Athlone) with
three regiments of Dutch dragoons, in pursuit of the
mutineers; and these troops having overtaken the men
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment in Lincolnshire, about twenty
officers and five hundred men, who had previously
become convinced of their error, laid down their arms
and submitted themselves to the King's clemency. King
William III. is reported to have repeatedly expressed his
admiration of the firm loyalty and attachment evinced by
the officers and soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment to their
former sovereign, when he was forsaken by almost every
other person; and the King, after dismissing three or
four officers, pardoned the remainder of the regiment, and
ordered the first battalion to be completed to its establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>ment
from the second, and to proceed to its original
destination.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment having
transferred its serviceable men to the first, proceeded to
Scotland; and the first battalion embarked for the
Netherlands, where it arrived in the beginning of May,
1689, and joined the Dutch camp at Tongres in the early
part of June. The British troops were commanded by
the Earl of Marlborough,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and the combined army by
Prince Waldeck. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were employed in several
operations; and on the 25th of August they took part in
a sharp action with the French troops commanded by
Marshal d'Humieres, at <em>Walcourt</em>, in the province of
Namur. The enemy attacked a foraging-party, and this
brought on a sharp action, in which the British infantry
evinced firmness and intrepidity, particularly a detachment
under Colonel Robert Hodges;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and the French
were repulsed with considerable loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>During the winter, the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Regiment, having recruited its ranks, was sent from Scotland
to Holland; and in the summer of 1690 both battalions
took the field. On the 21st of June, the regiment
was on its march to Brussels; but Prince Waldeck, without
waiting for the arrival of the British troops, engaged
the French at Fleurus, and was defeated. This disaster
reduced the combined army to the necessity of limiting
its operations, and acting on the defensive during the
remainder of the campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1690, Marshal Duke Schomberg
was killed at the battle of the Boyne in Ireland; and the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment remained vacant until
the 5th of March, 1691, when it was conferred by King
William III. on Lieut.-Colonel Sir Robert Douglas.</p>

<p>The regiment having been withdrawn from its winter
quarters in the month of March, 1691, was encamped at
Halle, in South Brabant, where the first battalion was
formed in brigade with the Scots Foot Guards, and the
regiments of Ramsay, Angus, Mackay, and Hodges; and
the second battalion was posted, with O'Ffarrel's regiment,
between two divisions of Dutch infantry.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The
French besieged Mons, and the confederates being unable
to relieve the place, the garrison surrendered on the 31st
of March, when the French troops went into quarters.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Mons, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was
sent into garrison, from whence it was withdrawn in May,
and was encamped near Brussels, and both battalions
were formed in one brigade with the Scots regiments of
Mackay, Ramsay, O'Ffarrel, and Angus, under the orders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of Brigadier-General Ramsay. The summer was passed
by the opposing armies in man&#339;uvring on the rich plains
of the Netherlands; and in October the troops marched
into quarters for the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>In the spring of 1692, Louis XIV. marched into the
Netherlands with an immense army and besieged Namur,
when the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was called from its cantonments,
and advanced with the army, commanded by
King William III. in person, to the relief of the place;
but the march having been delayed by heavy rains, the
garrison surrendered on the 20th of June. On the 23rd
of that month, Colonel Sir Robert Douglas, with 2 captains,
2 lieutenants, 2 ensigns, and 120 private men,
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, was detached, with other
troops, to attempt the surprise of Mons. After marching
all night, the detachment arrived about one o'clock
on the following morning within a short distance of the
town, when the troops were ordered to halt, and Sir
Robert Douglas and Colonel O'Ffarrel, having proceeded
to consult with the Prince of Wirtemberg, who commanded
the party, mistook their way in the dark, and
fell into the hands of a detachment of French cavalry,
and were made prisoners. The enemy being found prepared
to resist, the detachment returned to the camp at
Mell&eacute;, and Sir Robert Douglas was released on payment
of the regulated ransom, and rejoined the regiment on
the 29th of June.</p>

<p>After several changes of position, King William resolved
to attack the French army commanded by Marshal
Luxembourg, at its camp, near <em>Steenkirk</em>. On the evening
of the 23rd of July (O.S.), the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, commanded by Sir Robert Douglas,
the second battalion of the 1st Foot Guards, with the
regiments of Fitzpatrick and O'Ffarrel, and two bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>talions
of Danes, were ordered forward to commence the
attack on the French army, and were accompanied by a
detachment from each battalion of Brigadier-General
Churchill's brigade, with hatchets and spades to make a
passage through the woody grounds between the two
armies. Between ten and eleven o'clock on the following
morning these troops arrived in front of the French camp,
and took post in a thick wood, beyond which there was
a small valley intersected with hedges lined with French
infantry, and on the opposite side of the valley appeared
the French camp. About eleven o'clock two batteries
opened their fire upon the enemy; and when the main
body of the army had arrived within a mile of the wood,
the leading regiments issued from amongst the trees and
commenced the attack. "Certainly never was a more
dreadful and at the same time bolder firing heard,
which for the space of two hours seemed to be a continued
thunder. Our van-guard behaved in this engagement
to such wonder and admiration, that though
they received the charge of several battalions of the
enemy, one after another, yet they made them retreat
almost to their very camp."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Amongst the foremost
in this action was seen the brave Sir Robert Douglas at
the head of the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment,
emulating the noblest actions recorded in the annals of
war. Having led his battalion against the troops behind
the first hedge, he soon cleared it of French combatants,
and drove one of the enemy's battalions from the field in
confusion. A second hedge was attacked and carried by
the gallant Scots in a few moments:&mdash;a third was assaulted,&mdash;the
French stood their ground,&mdash;the combatants
fought muzzle to muzzle,&mdash;and again the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> proved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>victorious, and the third hedge was won. The toil of
conflict did not cool the ardour of the veteran Scots; but
forward they rushed with a loud huzza, and attacked the
troops which lined the fourth hedge. Here the fighting
was severe; but eventually the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> overthrew a
fourth French battalion, and drove a crowd of combatants
from their cannon.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In this conflict the first battalion
lost one of its three colours. Sir Robert Douglas, seeing
the colour on the other side of the hedge, leaped through
a gap, slew the French officer who bore the colour, and
cast it over the hedge to his own men; but this act of
gallantry cost him his life, a French marksman having
shot him dead on the spot while in the act of repassing
the hedge. "Thus the Scots commander improved upon
the Roman general; for the brave Posthumius cast his
standard in the middle of the enemy for his soldiers to
retrieve; but Douglas retrieved his from the middle of
the enemy, without any assistance, and cast it back to
his soldiers to retain."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> While the leading regiments
were thus carrying all before them, the main body of the
army was a mile in the rear, and could not be brought
up in time to sustain the corps in advance: the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
and other regiments of the advance-guard, after displaying
a degree of constancy and valour seldom equalled,
were forced to retire; and eventually the army retreated
to its camp.</p>

<p class="right">[To face page 83.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The loss of the regiment in this action has not been
ascertained. Mention has, however, been made in history
of two Captains, viz. Mackraken and Levingston,
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, who were killed; and from the
returns published at the time, the brigade to which the
regiment belonged lost 6 field officers, 14 captains,
24 subalterns, and 507 men killed; and 6 field officers,
20 captains, 32 subalterns, and 608 men wounded<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>;
and doubtless a number of these belonged to the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle, King William conferred
the Colonelcy on Lord George Hamilton (afterwards Earl
of Orkney) from the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of August, a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment, commanded by Captain Rowland Mackenzie,
was engaged with a party of French troopers in a wood
near the camp, and took twenty prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Towards
the end of September the regiment marched from the
camp to Bruges, from whence parties were detached to
Scotland to procure recruits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>Having passed the winter at Bruges, where the losses
of the preceding campaign were replaced by recruits
from Scotland, the regiment marched out of its quarters
towards the end of April, 1693, and pitched its tents on
the levels near the town, from whence it proceeded to
the villages near Brussels, where it arrived on the 13th
of May. On the 17th, it marched out of its village cantonments
and joined the camp at Dieghem, from whence
it subsequently marched to Parck camp in front of
Louvaine, and had its post on the heights near Birbeck.
Here it was stationed until the early part of July, when
the army advanced, and, after several marches, the regiment
was in position on the 18th of July, near the village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>of Neer-Winden, in South Brabant. The first battalion
had its post in the village of <em>Neer-Landen</em>, near the left
of the line, and its grenadier company occupied a strong
building at the head of the village. The second battalion
was stationed on the right of the village, where a slight
entrenchment was made during the night.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 19th of July, when the first
rays of light appeared, a French army, commanded by
Marshal Luxembourg, of nearly double the numbers of
the confederates under King William, was discovered in
order of battle within cannon-shot of the position. The
batteries instantly opened their fire, and, about eight
o'clock, six French brigades attacked the post at La&eacute;r
and Neer-Winden, but were repulsed. The enemy next
attacked the village of Neer-Landen with four brigades,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
and the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment stood its
ground manfully. The French came rushing to the
attack with great fury, but the head of their column was
pierced by a shower of musket balls, and the killed and
wounded crowded the street, while the grenadiers of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment threw their grenades, with unerring
aim, from the windows of the house they occupied. The
French, however, pressed forward, and the battalion,
being unable to resist the host of combatants which
assailed it, was forced to retire; at the same time the
house occupied by the grenadiers was set on fire. At
this moment the Queen Dowager's Regiment (now 2nd
Foot, or Queen's Royal) advanced to the assistance of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and the two battalions renewed the fight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>with great bravery. Prince Frederick's and Fagel's
Dutch regiments also advanced to support the two
British battalions; at the same time King William came
galloping to that part of the field, and his presence inspired
the combatants with new ardour. The French
disputed the ground for some time, but after a fierce
conflict of about two hours' duration, they gave way, and
were driven through the defile into the plain; and the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> and Queen Dowager's battalions, which had
fought together at Tangier in Africa, stood triumphant
at the end of the village, and were thanked for their
gallantry by the King. Notwithstanding this success,
the fortune of the day turned eventually in favour of the
French, who carried the village of Neer-Winden, and
broke into the King's camp, when their superiority of
numbers gave them a decided advantage. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were withdrawn from their post; and the King ordered
a retreat, which was effected with difficulty, and was
attended with great loss. The loss of the enemy was,
however, so great, that he derived little advantage from
this victory, excepting the power of besieging Charleroi,
which was taken in the autumn. The loss of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment does not appear to have been great; the only
officers of this corps mentioned by D'Auvergne amongst
the killed and wounded are&mdash;Captain Young died of his
wounds, with Captain Sir James Cockburn, Lieutenants
Brown and Blake, and Ensign White wounded. In
October the regiment marched to Bruges, and parties
were again sent to Scotland to procure recruits to replace
the loss sustained during this campaign.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May, 1694, the first battalion marched
out of its winter quarters, and on the following day
encamped near Ghent; and, resuming its march on the
21st, proceeded to the general rendezvous of the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
near Louvaine, where it arrived on the 28th of that
month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the second battalion remained in garrison
at Bruges, and in June it marched out of the town and
encamped along the banks of the canal towards Ghent,
where a small army of observation was assembled under
the orders of the Spanish general, Count de Merode
Thian.</p>

<p>The first battalion marched with the army commanded
by King William in person, from the vicinity of Louvaine,
on the 13th of July, and was afterwards encamped at
Mont St. Andr&eacute;. In the middle of August the King
attempted by a forced march to cross the enemy's lines
and penetrate into French Flanders; but the French, by
extraordinary exertions, gained the pass first, and thus
preserved their country from an invasion.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August the second battalion
quitted its post on the Bruges Canal, and joined the first
battalion at the camp at Roussela&eacute;r; and both battalions
formed part of the covering army during the period the
Prussians and Dutch were engaged in the siege of Huy,
and the men, having to remain in the fields in wet weather,
erected huts of wood and straw. Huy surrendered on
the 17th of September, and in October the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment returned to its former station at Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>Having passed the winter and spring in convenient
quarters, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment again took the field on
the 26th of May, 1695; and on the 21st of June the
first battalion, commanded by Colonel Lord George
Hamilton, was detached to engage in the siege of the
strong fortress of <em>Namur</em>; at the same time, the second
battalion remained with the covering army, commanded
by the Prince of Vaudemont, encamped near the river Lys.</p>

<p>Namur was, at this period, deemed almost impregnable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and the garrison, consisting of twenty battalions of infantry,
and twenty-four squadrons of dragoons, was
commanded by Marshal Boufflers, an officer celebrated
for bravery and perseverance; a vigorous defence was
consequently anticipated.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was stationed
for several days at Templeux, a post about five
miles from Namur, and on the 8th of July it took its
station in the lines of circumvallation, and was ordered
to take part in an assault upon the covered-way near the
hill of Bouge, on the same evening. The signal for the
attack was given about seven o'clock, when the Foot
Guards advanced boldly up to the enemy's palisades,
and placed the muzzles of their muskets between the
staves, fired a volley which put the French into some
confusion. The palisades were afterwards broken, and
the troops rushed forward to attack the second covered-way.
During the first attack the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> supported the
Dutch Foot Guards, but when the first palisades were
broken down, the Scots rushed furiously forward with
the Foot Guards, the second covered-way was carried,
the French were overpowered, driven from their works,
and chased amongst the batteries on the brow of the hill,
and many of them sought a refuge from the fury of their
assailants in the stone pits. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> gained great
credit for their conduct on this occasion; and had Captains
Sanderson and Dixon, Lieutenant Penefather, and
Ensign Cockburn, killed; and Colonel Lord George
Hamilton, Captain Hamilton, and Ensigns Carre and
Vernal, wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July the battalion was on duty in the
trenches, and as it marched out on the following day
Major Macilivan was killed by a cannon-ball from the
castle of Namur: on the same day its Colonel was pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>moted
to the rank of Brigadier-General. The battalion
was again on duty in the trenches on the 13th of July;
and on the evening of the 17th it was engaged in storming
the counterscarp. The attack was commenced by the
grenadiers, who rushed to the glacis, cast their grenades
over the palisades into the covered-way, and, following
up this attack with spirit, the troops carried the counterscarp
in gallant style.</p>

<p>An assault was made on the 23rd of July, on the
covered-way and traverses between the bastion of St.
Roche and the Porte de Fer, and the first battalion of
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed part of the storming party.
The attack was made a little before sunset, and, after a
sharp contest, a lodgment was effected. The only loss
sustained by the battalion in this service appears to have
been Lieutenant Archibald Hamilton and a few private
men wounded. The Dutch and Brandenburgers were
also successful at their points of attack, and on the 24th
of July, when preparations were making for another
assault, the garrison hoisted a white flag, and agreed to
surrender the town, which was delivered up on the following
day, when the garrison retired into the castle,
where they resolved to defend themselves to the last extremity.</p>

<p>After the surrender of the town of Namur the first
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment marched from the lines
of circumvallation to Genappe, where a small force was
assembled under the Earl of Athlone to co-operate with
the covering army; Captain Burgh and Lieutenant
Wallis of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, however, remained with the forces
engaged in the siege of the castle, in the capacity of
engineers. From Genappe the first battalion marched
to the village of Waterloo, and there pitched its tents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Meanwhile, the second battalion had been engaged in
several movements for the preservation of Ghent, Bruges,
and the maritime towns of Flanders, and was, at this
period, encamped near Brussels. The confederate army
being thus divided, part carrying on the siege of the
castle of Namur, and the remainder stationed in various
places in the Netherlands, the French commander,
Marshal Villeroy, having assembled an immense army,
advanced to Brussels and bombarded the city; he afterwards
marched towards Namur, with the design of
raising the siege of the castle; when both battalions of
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, with the remainder of the covering
army, proceeded to the vicinity of Namur, and took up
a position to cover the siege. This position the French
commander did not venture to attack, and the siege of
the castle was prosecuted with vigour. On the 20th of
August, the grenadier companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
quitted the covering army to take part in an assault
upon the castle, and were engaged in storming the counterscarp
and breach of the Terra Nova, under the orders
of Lord Cutts. This proved a severe and sanguinary
service; the assailants and defenders fought with distinguished
bravery, and, although the castle was not carried,
yet several lodgments were effected. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had
Lieutenant William Hamilton and several men killed,
and others wounded; Lieutenant Archibald Hamilton,
who was wounded in the third attack on the town, was
again wounded on this occasion. Preparations were
afterwards made for a second assault, when the garrison
surrendered, and marched out on the 26th of August
(O.S.) Thus this important conquest was effected, and
the military reputation of King William was elevated;
at the same time, new lustre was reflected on the confe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>derate
arms. The summer having been spent in making
this capture, after the works were repaired, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
marched back to Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>In this city they passed the winter, and the losses of
the preceding campaign were replaced. On the 9th of
May, 1696, they marched out of Bruges, and pitched
their tents along the banks of the canal towards Ghent;
and having received their new clothing from England a
few days before, they were reviewed, with several other
corps, on the 16th of May, by the Prince of Vaudemont,
and on the 28th by King William, and their appearance
and discipline excited admiration.</p>

<p>The regiment passed this summer in camp along the
banks of the Bruges canal, having its post on the right
of the bridge at Mary-Kirk; and in the autumn it again
proceeded into quarters at Bruges, where five regiments
of cavalry and eleven of infantry were stationed during
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>In the spring of 1697, when the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
took the field, four companies were left in garrison at
Bruges, where they remained during the summer. The
remainder of the regiment marched to Brussels in the
early part of March, and advanced from thence on the
12th of April to Waterloo, where a camp was formed of
four English and eight Dutch battalions. The regiment
was subsequently engaged in the several operations of
the main army under King William; during the latter
part of the month of May and the beginning of June
it was encamped, with the army, on the plain of Bois-Seigneur-Isaac,
and was stationed in front of the King's
quarter; in the middle of June it marched to the vicinity
of Brussels, and was encamped before that city until the
war was terminated by the treaty of Ryswick, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
signed during the night between the 10th and 11th of
September, 1697.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698</div>

<div class="sidenote">1699</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment marched from Brussels to Ghent, and
during the winter it embarked for Ireland; at the same
time a reduction of four companies was made in the establishment.
A further reduction was subsequently made,
and in a warrant under the sign manual, bearing date the
1st of May, 1699, the numbers of the regiment are fixed
at 22 companies of 3 officers, 2 serjeants, 2 corporals, 1
drummer, and 34 private men each.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1700</div>

<p>Events transpired in Europe at the close of the year
1700 which occasioned the regiment to be again placed
on a war establishment and sent on foreign service.</p>

<p>These events were the decease of Charles II., King of
Spain, on the 1st of November, 1700, without issue, and
the accession of Philip Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis
XIV. of France, to the throne of Spain, in violation of
existing treaties, and to the prejudice of the house of
Austria. Several European states being averse to the
accession either of an Austrian or Bourbon prince to the
throne of the Spanish monarchy, a partition had been
contemplated; but the sudden acquisition of the dominions
of Spain by a grandson of the most potent and
ambitious monarch in Europe, with the prospect of
France and Spain being eventually united under one
sovereign, rendered the partition-treaty abortive, agitated
the public mind, and produced a sensation of
alarm throughout the greater part of Christendom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1701</div>

<p>The interest of every state being affected by the change
in the dynasty of Spain, the standing armies were augmented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and, while the din of hostile preparation was
heard on every side, negotiations were commenced with
the view of preventing a war. The French monarch,
however, sent a body of troops to take possession of
the Spanish Netherlands, and detained 15,000 Dutch,
who, in virtue of a convention with Spain, formed the
garrisons of the barrier towns. The loss of so large a
body of their best troops, with the advance of a French
army towards their frontiers, alarmed the States General
of the United Provinces, and King William sent thirteen
British battalions to Holland to assist the Dutch.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having been augmented to
24 companies of 3 officers, 3 serjeants, 3 corporals, 2
drummers, and 59 private men each, was one of the
corps selected to proceed on foreign service; it accordingly
embarked at the Cove of Cork on the 15th of June,
1701, in two ships of war, and sailing on the following
day, arrived at Helvoetsluys, on the island of Voorn, in
South Holland, on the 8th of July. Here the English
troops were removed from the ships of war on board of
Dutch vessels, and sailed up the river Maese to the several
garrisons of Breda, Gertruydenberg, Huesden,
Worcum, Gorcum, and Borsch. From these stations
they were recalled in the middle of September to the
vicinity of Breda, and encamped on Breda Heath, where
they were reviewed on the 21st of that month by King
William, and afterwards returned to their former stations.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the death of King James II. had occurred
at St. Germain in France, and Louis XIV. caused the
Pretender to be proclaimed King of England, Scotland,
and Ireland. This indignity offered to the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
sovereign and nation aroused the indignation of the
people; the army was again augmented, and in the
following spring additional forces were sent to Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having passed the winter
amongst the Dutch, quitted its cantonments on the 10th
of March, and proceeded to Rosendael, where the British
infantry assembled and encamped under the orders of
Brigadier-General Ingoldsby. Here the troops received
information of the death of King William III. on the
8th of March, and of the accession of Queen Anne.
They also learnt that Her Majesty was resolved to prosecute
the war with vigour, and the officers and soldiers
took the oath of allegiance to the Queen.</p>

<p>In the middle of April a strong fortress on the Lower
Rhine called <em>Kayserswerth</em>, which was occupied by the
French, was besieged by the Germans, and a few days
afterwards the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> and other British corps quitting
their camp at Rosendael, marched across the country
to the Duchy of Cleves, where they joined a body of
Dutch and Germans under the Earl of Athlone, and encamped
at Cranenburg on the Lower Rhine to cover the
siege. While the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment lay with the army
at this camp, a French force of superior numbers, commanded
by the Duke of Burgundy and Marshal Boufflers,
traversed the forest of Cleves, and advanced through
the plains of Goch to cut off the communication of the
allied army with Grave and Nimeguen. In consequence
of this movement, the allied army struck its tents a little
before sunset on the 10th of June, and having continued
its retreat throughout the night, arrived about eight
o'clock on the following morning within a few miles of
<em>Nimeguen</em>, at the same time the French columns appeared
on both flanks and in the rear, marching with all
possible expedition to surround the allies. Some sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
skirmishing occurred; the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, Foot Guards, and
other British corps forming the rear guard, behaved with
distinguished gallantry, and having taken possession of
some hedges and buildings, held the enemy in check
while the army effected its retreat under the works of
Nimeguen: in three days afterwards Kayserswerth
surrendered.</p>

<p>In the meantime additional forces had arrived from
England, and the Earl of Marlborough assumed the
command of the British, Dutch, and auxiliary troops.
The French had, at this period, overrun the Duchy of
Cleves, and were menacing the frontiers of Holland;
but when the Earl of Marlborough had assembled the
troops of the several nations, he advanced against the
enemy, and by skilful movements forced the French
commanders to retire. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the
force under the Earl of Marlborough, and were engaged
in several movements designed to bring on a general
action, which the enemy avoided. In September the
regiment was encamped a few miles from Maestricht, and
formed part of the covering army during the siege of
<em>Venloo</em>, a town in the province of Limburg, on the east
side of the river Maese, which surrendered on the 25th
of September. In a few days after the capture of this
place, the siege of <em>Ruremonde</em> was undertaken; at the
same time one battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, commanded
by Brigadier-General the Earl of Orkney, was
detached, with other troops, from the main army near
Maestricht to besiege <em>Stevenswart</em>, or Fort St. Etienne,
situated on a small island in the river Maese, nineteen
miles from Maestricht. Two batteries opened a sharp
fire against the fort in the beginning of October, and at
day-break on the morning of the third of that month the
troops reared their ladders against the walls and began
to ascend to attack the place sword in hand, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
garrison beat a parley and surrendered. The battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment rejoined the army on the 6th of
October, and Ruremonde surrendered on the same day.
On the tenth, at one o'clock in the morning, the main
army struck its tents and advanced in two columns towards
the city of <em>Liege</em>, and at four in the afternoon
encamped near the works. The French set the suburb
of St. Walburgh on fire, and retired into the citadel and
Chartreuse, when the magistrates delivered up the city,
and the army commenced the siege of the citadel, which
was taken by storm on the 23rd of October; the British
grenadiers and fusiliers engaged in the assault highly
distinguished themselves, and had 154 officers and soldiers
killed, and 380 wounded. The Chartreuse surrendered
a few days afterwards; and these conquests terminated
the campaign. The British troops quitted the
pleasant valley of Liege on the 3rd of November, and
marched to Tongres, where they halted one day, and
afterwards continued their route to Holland; the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment proceeded to Breda, in which city it appears
to have passed the winter in garrison, together with a
battalion of Foot Guards and two or three other corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>Leaving these quarters towards the end of April,
1703, the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment traversed the country to the
vicinity of Maestricht. Meanwhile the Dutch and Germans
were besieging Bonn, a strong town on the Rhine;
and the French commanders, Marshal Villeroy and Boufflers,
thinking to take advantage of the dispersed state of
the army, made a sudden advance to surprise the troops
in their quarters. The first attack was made on two
British regiments<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> at Tongres, a town surrounded by
a wall and defended by a few dilapidated towers; these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>regiments, however, defended themselves upwards of
twenty-four hours before they surrendered. While the
contest was in progress at Tongres, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with a
number of other corps, struck their tents, and proceeding
to Maestricht, formed in order of battle near the works;
the French commanders advanced and reconnoitred the
position, and, after a sharp cannonade, retreated to
Tongres.</p>

<p>Bonn surrendered in the middle of May, and the army
was afterwards assembled in the vicinity of Maestricht,
where the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was
formed in brigade with the battalion of Foot Guards,
and the regiments of Stewart, Howe, Ingoldsby, and
Marlborough,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> under the orders of Brigadier-General
Withers; and the second battalion with the regiments of
North and Grey, Derby, Row, and Ferguson,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> under
the command of Brigadier-General the Earl of Derby.
On the 24th of May the army advanced towards Tongres,
when the French quitted their post and made a
precipitate retreat, and the confederates encamped at
Thys. The army subsequently made several movements
for the purpose of bringing on a general engagement,
which the French avoided, and took post behind their
fortified lines, where the <span class="smcap">Duke of Marlborough</span> was
desirous of attacking them, but was prevented by the
Dutch generals and field deputies. In August the army
advanced to <em>Huy</em>, a strong fortress on the Maese above
the city of Liege, which was besieged and captured in
ten days. Another proposal to attack the French lines
was declined by the Dutch; and the main army afterwards
advanced to St. Trond; at the same time a detachment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>invested <em>Limburg</em>, a city of the Spanish Netherlands
situated on a pleasant eminence amongst the woods
near the banks of the little river Wesdet. The siege of
this place was commenced on the 10th of September,
and on the 27th the governor, with a garrison of 1400
men, surrendered at discretion. Thus Spanish Guelderland
was delivered from the power of France, and the
Dutch were freed from the dread of an invasion. The
capture of Limburg was followed by the separation of
the army for the winter; the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment struck its
tents on the 10th of October, and proceeded to the neighbourhood
of Tongres, where it halted ten days, and
afterwards continued its march through the province of
Limburg to Holland.</p>

<p>While the army, of which the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed
part, was engaged in operations in the Netherlands, the
Elector of Bavaria took arms against the Emperor of
Germany; and a French force commanded by Marshal
Villiers having traversed the Black Forest and joined the
Bavarians, the united armies were making considerable
progress in the heart of Germany. This event occasioned
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with a great portion of the English and
Dutch forces under the Duke of Marlborough, to transfer
their services from the Low Countries to Germany, to
arrest the progress of the French and Bavarians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>Previous to quitting the Netherlands, the regiment
sent a detachment of six hundred men to Maestricht to
garrison that city, while the Dutch troops were working
at the entrenchments on the heights of Petersberg. In
the early part of May, 1704, the remainder of the regiment
marched from its winter quarters towards the Rhine,
and was joined at Bedburg by the detachment from
Maestricht. On the 19th of May the army directed its
march from Bedburg along the course of the Rhine to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>wards
the Moselle, and traversed both rivers at Coblentz
on the 25th and 26th of that month; thence proceeding
towards the Maine, arrived at the suburbs of Mentz in
the beginning of June; the cavalry being in advance with
the Duke of Marlborough, the infantry and artillery
a few stages in the rear under General Charles Churchill.
From the Maine the infantry directed its march through
the Landgraviate of Hesse, towards the Neckar, passed
this river on the 15th of June, and proceeding in the
direction of the Danube, was soon afterwards at the seat
of war in Germany, and co-operating with the forces of
the empire.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of July, at three o'clock in the morning,
the army marched in the direction of Donawerth, to
attack a body of French and Bavarians under the Count
d'Arco, in an entrenched camp on the heights of <em>Schellenberg</em>,
on the left bank of the Danube. After traversing
a difficult tract of country, the troops crossed the
river Wernitz and arrived in front of the enemy's camp,
and about six in the evening the leading division, consisting
of a detachment from each British regiment, with
the Foot Guards, <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and Ingoldsby's regiment
(23rd), commanded by Brigadier-General Fergusson,
and a Dutch force under General Goor, advanced under
cover of a heavy cannonade, to attack the enemy's entrenchments.
When these brave troops arrived within
the range of the enemy's cannon they were assailed by a
volley of grape, which produced a dreadful carnage.
General Goor and many brave officers fell; Lieut.-Col.
White of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was severely wounded; yet the
assailants moved forward with a firm tread until they
arrived at a ravine which they were unable to pass, when
they shrunk back before the shower of bullets which
assailed them. At this moment the enemy issued from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
the entrenchments and charged the British and Dutch with
great fury, but were gallantly opposed by the English
Foot Guards. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and Ingoldsby's regiment
also confronted the charging Bavarians with firmness,
and the enemy was repulsed and driven back into the
entrenchments. A second attack was soon afterwards
made on the heights, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were again sharply
engaged. The French and Bavarians made a vigorous
resistance, and sallying from the trenches attacked the
leading regiments of the allies; the British and Dutch
infantry being exhausted by a continued struggle up
a rising ground, and their ranks thinned by a destructive
fire, once more shrunk back; they were, however,
supported by the cavalry under Lieut.-General Lumley,
and having rallied, they returned to the attack with great
resolution. This protracted contest shook the strength
and weakened the resistance of the enemy. The Imperialists,
commanded by the Margrave of Baden, arrived
at the scene of conflict and attacked the enemy's left; at
the same time the British and Dutch made another furious
attack. Three field-officers of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had already
been carried from the field wounded, yet the regiment
was seen pressing upon the enemy, and making a desperate
effort to force the entrenchments; the Scots Greys
dismounted to join in the attack; and the French and
Bavarians were overpowered and driven from the heights
with dreadful carnage. The cavalry under General
Lumley charged the fugitives, and completed the overthrow
of the enemy. Sixteen pieces of artillery, a number
of standards and colours, with the enemy's tents, and the
equipage, and the plate of Count d'Arco, fell into the
hands of the confederates.</p>

<p>Thus the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were triumphant near the same
ground where the regiment, when forming part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Green Brigade</span> in the service of Gustavus Adolphus,
distinguished itself in March 1632.</p>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment had Captain
Murray, Ensigns M'Dugal and M'Ilroy, one serjeant,
and 38 rank and file killed; and Lieut.-Colonel White,
Major Cockburn, Captains Hume, Irwin, and Brown;
Lieutenants Kid and Ballatine; Ensigns Stratton, Cunningham,
and Stewart; with 3 serjeants, and 103 rank
and file, wounded.</p>

<p>The second battalion had Captain Baily and Lieutenant
Levingston, with 1 serjeant and 76 private men,
killed; and Major Kerr, Captain Carr, Lieutenants
Pearson, Moore, Vernel, Hay, Dickson, and Hamilton,
Ensigns M'Queen, M'Onway, Moremere, Elliot, Inglis,
and Moore, with 12 serjeants, and 184 rank and file,
wounded.</p>

<p>The victory at Schellenberg was immediately followed
by the flight of the enemy from Donawerth, which place
was taken possession of by the allies. At the same time
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment crossed the Danube, and advancing
into Bavaria, was engaged in operations with the army;
while the French and Bavarians, having made a hasty
retreat to Augsburg, formed an entrenched camp near
that city. The enemy also abandoned several small towns,
which were taken possession of by the allies, and Rayn
was captured after a short siege. The army afterwards
advanced towards Augsburg, and halted a short time
within sight of the enemy's fortified camp. In the mean
time each regiment sent out parties to plunder the country.
This occasioned the Elector of Bavaria to engage in a
treaty with the view of an accommodation; but he soon
afterwards received information that another reinforcement
of French troops had traversed the Black Forest,
when he broke off the treaty, which so incensed the Imperialists
that they laid a great part of Bavaria in ashes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortified camp at Augsburg being found too strong
to be attacked with any prospect of success, the troops
retired a few stages, and the siege of Ingoldstadt was
undertaken by a detachment of Germans, at the same
time the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed part of the covering
army.</p>

<p>The Elector of Bavaria quitted his entrenched camp,
and having formed a junction with the reinforcements
which Louis XIV. had sent to his aid, the united armies
encamped in the valley of the Danube, near the village of
<em>Blenheim</em>. At the same time the allied army, commanded
by the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene
of Savoy, had advanced to the village of Minster, and
was encamped with its left to the Danube.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the eventful 13th
of August, 1704, the allies advanced to attack the French
and Bavarians. About seven the heads of columns arrived
in presence of the enemy, and a pause ensuing, the
chaplains performed the usual service at the heads of
their respective regiments. About mid-day, a column, of
which one battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed part,
advanced under the direction of Lieut.-General Lord
Cutts and Major-General Wilks, to attack the village of
<em>Blenheim</em>, where the French commander, Marshal
Tallard, had posted a considerable number of troops, and
entrenchments and pallisades had been constructed. This
column, consisting of the two British brigades, commanded
by Brigadier-Generals Row and Fergusson, a brigade of
Hessians, and a brigade of Hanoverians, proceeded to the
banks of the little river Nebel, and took possession of two
water mills, which the enemy evacuated, and set on fire.
Thence advancing towards the inclosures, the leading
brigade received the fire of the troops in Blenheim, and
many officers and men fell; but the gallant Row struck
his sword in the enemy's pallisades before he gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
word "fire." His brigade was, however, unable to force
the entrenchments against the superior numbers of the
enemy; and while retiring it was charged by the French
cavalry, but the enemy was repulsed by the Hessians.
Soon afterwards, Fergusson's brigade and the Hanoverians
traversed the Nebel, near the lower water-mill, and
attacked the front of the village, but were repulsed three
successive times; the firing was, however, continued
against Blenheim; and the remainder of the forces traversed
the rivulet, and attacked the main body of the
French army. The other battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
was now brought into action; the blaze of musketry
extended along the whole front; and the troops of
the several nations fought with distinguished bravery.
The combat of musketry, and the charges of the cavalry,
were continued for some time with varied success.
Eventually the main body of the enemy was overpowered,
and chased from the field with great slaughter; many
prisoners were also captured, and amongst them the
French commander, Marshal Tallard.</p>

<p>When the main body of the French army was defeated,
the troops posted in Blenheim attempted to escape by the
rear of the village, but were repulsed. A second attempt
was made in another direction, but was checked by the
Scots Greys. A third attempt was also made, but the
French were again driven back, and forced to take shelter
behind the houses and inclosures. Though encompassed
and intercepted on every side, the French obstinately
defended their post. Additional forces were brought
against them; the batteries opened a tremendous fire;
Lieut.-General the Earl of Orkney attacked the French
troops posted in the churchyard with eight battalions;
Lieut.-General Ingoldsby attacked the right side of the
village with four battalions, supported by the Royal Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
(late 5th) Dragoons; and both battalions of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were now engaged. A sharp struggle ensued, which
ended in a parley, and eventually twenty-four French
battalions of infantry, and twelve squadrons of cavalry,
surrendered prisoners of war. The Germans who attacked
the enemy's right were also triumphant. Thus the
struggle of this eventful day ended in a complete victory,
which reflected lustre on the confederate arms, and showed
in its native colours the true character of the British
soldier. The French and Bavarians are reported to have
lost in killed, wounded, prisoners, and from other causes,
about forty thousand men, with nearly all their tents,
cannon, and ammunition, and a great number of standards,
colours, and kettle-drums.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment lost in this action<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Lieut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>-Colonel
White, Ensigns M'Conway and Craig, killed;
Captain Lord Forbes died of his wounds; and Captains
Montgomery, Bruce, and Lindsay, with Lieutenants
Harrowby and Lisle, and Ensign Hume, wounded.</p>

<p>The number of French and Bavarians taken on this
occasion was so great that the second battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the regiments of Prince George of Denmark,
Lords North and Grey, Row and Meredith, commanded
by Brigadier-General Fergusson, were sent to
Holland in charge of the prisoners. These troops marched
with the prisoners to Mentz, where they embarked in
boats and sailed to Holland, and, having delivered them
into the charge of other corps, were placed in garrison
for the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the first battalion continued with the army
in Germany; and the enemy abandoned several important
cities, which were occupied by the allies. The
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment proceeded through the
circle of Swabia and directed its march to Philipsburg,
where it crossed the Rhine on the 7th of September, and
subsequently formed part of the covering army during the
siege of <em>Landau</em>, a town in the Bavarian circle of the
Rhine, situated in a beautiful valley on the river Queich.
On the 13th of October this battalion, with the regiments
of Hamilton, Ingoldsby, and Tatton, marched from the
covering army encamped at Croon-Weissemberg to Germersheim,
and embarking in boats, sailed down the Rhine
to Holland, and were placed in garrison for the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>In the following spring, the losses of the preceding
campaign were replaced with recruits from Scotland; and
in April the regiment quitted its quarters, and directed
its march towards Maestricht, passed that city on the
13th of May, and proceeded to Juliers. From Juliers
the regiment proceeded through a mountainous country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to the valley of the Moselle, in the midst of which stands
the ancient city of Treves, where both battalions encamped
on the 28th of May. The British and Dutch,
with several German corps, having assembled in the
neighbourhood of Treves, the army passed the Moselle
and the Saar on the 3rd of June, and advanced towards
Syrk, near which place a French army of superior numbers,
commanded by Marshal Villiers, was encamped. The
allied army halted a short distance from the enemy,
and awaited the arrival of the Imperialists under the
Margrave of Baden, who had promised to co-operate with
the Duke of Marlborough in carrying on the war in this
direction: but this co-operation was delayed so long that
the British commander was forced to return to the Netherlands,
where the French were making considerable progress.</p>

<p>The retreat was commenced during the night of the
17th of June; and on the 20th, Lieut.-General the Earl
of Orkney was detached with all the grenadiers, and
one hundred men of each battalion, to observe the motions
of a detachment which Marshal Villiers had sent towards
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>The approach of the army towards the Maese alarmed
the French, and they raised the siege of the citadel of
Liege and retired. On the 4th of July the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was detached, with other forces
under General Schultz and Lieut.-General the Earl of
Orkney, to besiege <em>Huy</em>, which had been captured by the
French during the absence of the army up the Moselle.
On the 6th a battery of twelve cannon and six mortars
opened a sharp fire upon Fort Picard; and during the
afternoon of the same day the troops forced the covered-way
and reared their ladders against the walls, when the
French quitted this fort and also Fort Rouge, and fled
to the castle. On the 10th the batteries were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to bear on the castle and on Fort Joseph, and on the following
day the garrison surrendered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the French army, commanded by Marshal
Villeroy and the Elector of Bavaria, having taken refuge
behind their fortified lines, the Duke of Marlborough
had formed a scheme for forcing these stupendous barriers,
and the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment rejoined
the army in time to take part in this splendid
enterprise. The lines were menaced by a detachment on
the south of the Mehaine, which drew the greater part
of the French army to that quarter; and during the
night of the 17th of July the allied army marched to its
right, and at four o'clock on the following morning the
leading regiments approached the works at <em>Neer-Hespen</em>
and <em>Helixem</em>. Both battalions of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
were in the leading division. Their advance was concealed
by a thick fog, and under the cover of this obscurity
one column cleared the village of Neer-Winden
and Neer-Hespen, another gained the bridge and village
of Helixem, and a third carried the castle of Wange,
which commanded the passage over the Little Gheet.
Then rushing through the inclosures and marshy grounds,
the troops forded the river, and crowded over the defences
with an ardour which overcame all opposition. The
French guards were surprised and overpowered, and a
detachment of dragoons fled in a panic. Thus the lines
were forced; the pioneers were instantly set to work, and
in a short time a passage was made for the cavalry.
While this was in progress, the Marquis d'Allegre advanced
with twenty battalions of infantry, and fifty
squadrons of cavalry, and opened a sharp cannonade;
but his advance was retarded by a hollow way, which
gave time for more troops to pass the lines; and eventually
his forces were attacked and defeated, and the allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
took many prisoners, and also captured a number of
standards and colours. Speaking of this action, the
Duke of Marlborough observes in a letter published in his
memoirs,&mdash;"It is impossible to say too much good of the
troops that were with me, for never men fought better."</p>

<p>The enemy made a precipitate retreat, and took up a
position behind the river Dyle. The Duke of Marlborough
advanced with the design of passing the river,
but was prevented by heavy rains. On the 21st of July,
a small body of French troops passed the <em>Dyle</em>, when the
first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was ordered forward,
and a slight skirmish ensued. The French fled to
their lines, and a few companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> pursuing
too far, were fired upon from the works, and had one
captain killed and several men wounded. Major
General Wood was also wounded.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was subsequently engaged in
several man&#339;uvres; but the designs of the British commander
were frustrated by the inactivity and want of co-operation
on the part of the Dutch generals. The French
lines were demolished in the autumn; and a detachment
was sent to invest a small town and fortress on the Scheldt,
called Sandlivet, which surrendered on the 29th of October.
In the early part of November the regiment marched
back to Holland, and was placed in garrison for the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment again took the field in May,
1706, and proceeding to the province of Limburg, arrived
at the general rendezvous of the army at Bilsen,
near Tongres, on the 19th of that month. Advancing
from Bilsen, the army proceeded in the direction of Mont
St. Andr&eacute;; and on Whit-Sunday, the 23rd of May, as
the troops were on the march, the enemy's army, commanded
by Marshal Villeroy and the Elector of Bavaria,
was discovered forming in order of battle in the position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Mont St. Andr&eacute;, with their centre at the village of <em>Ramilies</em>,
which was occupied by a considerable body of troops.</p>

<p>The allied army, diverging into the open plain of
Jandrin&#339;uil, formed line, and advanced against the
enemy. The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having its post near the
right of the first line, formed on the heights of Foulz;
then descending, with several other British, Dutch, and
German corps, into the low grounds near the river,
menaced the villages of Autreglise and Offuz with an
attack. This movement occasioned the enemy to weaken
his centre to support his left flank, when the duke of
Marlborough made a powerful attack on the enemy's
centre and right. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were spectators of the
fight for above an hour; at length a critical period in the
engagement arrived, and the regiment was brought forward.
The veterans of Schellenberg and Blenheim
fought like men resolved to die rather than lose their
reputation; and the French, Spaniards, and Bavarians,
were overthrown and driven from the field with a terrible
slaughter. The fugitives were pursued many miles, and
an immense number of prisoners, with cannon, standards,
and colours, was captured. Thus a complete and decisive
victory was gained over an army of superior
numbers in less than three hours.</p>

<p>The wreck of the French army continued its precipitate
flight to Louvain, and immediately afterwards
abandoned that city, and also Brussels. The States of
Brabant, and the magistrates of Brussels, renounced their
allegiance to the Duke of Anjou. The principal towns
of Brabant, and several others in Flanders, were immediately
delivered up, and others surrendered on being
summoned, or in a few days afterwards. Dendermond
held out, and was blockaded in the early part of June;
and Ostend was afterwards besieged by a detachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
from the main army, and surrendered on the 6th of July.
Menin was besieged on the 25th of July, and surrendered
in August; and Dendermond was delivered up in the
early part of September. During these sieges the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
continued to form part of the covering army; but after
the surrender of Dendermond, one battalion of the regiment
was detached under Marshal d'Auverquerque and
Lieut.-General Ingoldsby, to besiege <em>Aeth</em>, a town and
fortress on the river Dender. This place was invested on
the 16th of September: the several attacks were carried
on with vigour, and the garrison surrendered on the 3rd
of October. The capture of Aeth was the last important
event of this glorious campaign: and in the early part of
November the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment marched into garrison
at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>Here the regiment passed the succeeding winter and
spring, and again took the field on the 16th of May,
1707, when the first battalion was formed in brigade with
the Foot Guards and the regiments of Godfrey and
Sabine (now 16th and 23rd), commanded by Brigadier-General
Meredith; and the second battalion with the
regiments of Webb, Ingoldsby, and Tatton, (now 8th,
18th, and 24th), and Temple's (since disbanded), under
the command of Brigadier General Sir Richard Temple,
afterwards Viscount Cobham. The opposing armies, however,
passed the campaign in man&#339;uvring, and observing
each other's movements; the French avoided a general engagement;
and in October the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> returned to Ghent.</p>

<p>In this year, the Union of Scotland with England
having taken place, the <em>Cross of St. Andrew</em> was placed
on the colours of the English regiments in addition to the
Cross of St. George&mdash;previously displayed; and the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment obtained as a regimental badge&mdash;the
<em>Royal Cypher</em>, within the <em>circle of St. Andrew</em>, sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>mounted
with <em>a crown</em>; instead of St. Andrew's Cross,
which it had formerly borne on its colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>While the regiment was reposing in winter quarters in
Flanders, the King of France fitted out a fleet and embarked
a body of troops at Dunkirk for the purpose of
making a descent on the British coast in favour of the
Pretender; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the Foot Guards and
seven other corps, were ordered to return to England to
repel the invaders. The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment marched
from Ghent on the 8th March, 1708 (O.S.), embarked at
Ostend on the 15th, and arrived at Tynemouth on the
21st. Meanwhile the French fleet, with the Pretender on
board, had sailed from Dunkirk; but being chased by the
British men-of-war, the enemy returned to Dunkirk without
effecting a landing. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were then ordered
back to Flanders, and having landed at Ostend on the
20th of April, proceeded in boats along the canal to Ghent.</p>

<p>The regiment remained at Ghent until the 22nd of
May, when it took the field and engaged in the general
operations of the army, and soon afterwards the French
obtained possession of Ghent and Bruges by treachery.
A more important advantage was, however, gained on
the 11th of July by the allied army commanded
by the Duke of Marlborough, who crossed the Scheldt
and defeated the French army, commanded by the
Duke of Burgundy and Marshal Vend&ocirc;me, near <em>Oudenarde</em>.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the division of
twenty battalions commanded by the Duke of Argyle,
and having traversed the Scheldt by the pontoon bridge
between Oudenarde and the Abbey of Eename, they
ascended the heights of Bevere; then, inclining to the
right, engaged the enemy in the fields and open grounds
beyond the rivulet. A fierce conflict of musketry ensued,
and charge succeeded charge, until the shades of evening
gathered over the scene of conflict, and the combatants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
could only be discerned by the flashes of musketry which
blazed in the fields and marshy grounds. The French,
having been driven from hedge to hedge, and from thicket
to thicket, were eventually overpowered. Part of their
army being separated from the remainder was nearly
surrounded and destroyed, and the work of destruction
was continued until the darkness became so intense that
it was impossible to distinguish friends from foes, when
the troops were ordered to cease firing. Night favoured
the enemy; many of the corps, which were nearly surrounded,
escaped in the dark, and the wreck of the
French army made a precipitate retreat to Ghent, leaving
the allies in possession of the field of battle, with many
prisoners, standards, colours, and other indisputable
marks of victory.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were subsequently employed in covering
the siege of <em>Lisle</em>, the capital of French Flanders, which
was captured by Louis XIV. in 1667, and ceded to
France by the treaty of peace in 1668. This city being
situated on a plain watered by several streams, and protected
by a series of stupendous works constructed under
the superintendence of Vauban, the celebrated French
engineer, and being defended by a garrison of 15,000
men commanded by the veteran Marshal Boufflers, who
was prepared with everything requisite for a protracted
defence, the siege was considered an undertaking of great
magnitude, and it excited universal attention. The French
made strenuous exertions to preserve the place, and an
immense body of troops advanced against the covering
army, of which the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed a part; but
the French Marshals were dismayed by the determined
countenance of the allies, and frustrated by the superior
tactics of the Duke of Marlborough. The enemy next
attempted to cut off the supplies of military stores and
provision from the army; and a quantity of stores having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
been sent from England to Ostend, and there placed in
waggons, one battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton, was detached from
the covering army to protect the stores from Ostend to
the camp. This battalion was sent, in the first instance,
to Oudenburg, with orders to wait there until the convoy
had passed, and afterwards to join the escort at Turout.
The waggons left Ostend on the 27th of September, and
continued their route towards the army; at the same
time the French commanders sent a detachment of 22,000
men under the orders of Count de la Motte to intercept
the convoy. After the waggons had proceeded a considerable
distance on their way, the battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment quitted Oudenburg and proceeded to
Turout, where information was received of the movements
of the enemy, when the battalion marched with all
possible expedition to succour the convoy, and arrived at
the wood of <em>Wynendale</em> at the moment when Major-General
Webb was forming the few troops he had with
him in an opening beyond the wood. The French had
to pass through the wood, and Major-General Webb
placed a battalion in ambush amongst the trees on each
side of the defile, and drew up the main body of his detachment,
which consisted of about 8000 men, in an open
space at the end of the defile. The French advanced in
full confidence to overwhelm a force which did not amount
to half their own numbers; but, when passing through
the wood, they were assailed by the ambush on their left,
which put them in some confusion. They, however, continued
to advance and broke through two of the battalions
of the allies posted at the end of the defile; but
the battalion in ambush on the enemy's right having
opened its fire, and the head of their column being attacked,
the French were repulsed and driven back through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the wood. They soon rallied and returned to the attack,
and were again assailed by a destructive fire in front and
on both flanks, and they shrunk back in dismay. The
attack was repeated, and the destructive cross fire was
again opened with the same results; and Count de la
Motte, being unable to induce his men to return to the
charge, he was forced to relinquish the contest and retire.
At this moment Lieut.-General Cadogan arrived with a
few squadrons of cavalry, and the convoy was conducted
in safety to the army. This gallant exploit excited great
admiration, and Major-General Webb was honoured with
the thanks of parliament, and the approbation of the
Queen, for his conduct on this occasion.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment continued to form part of the
covering army, and was employed in several services connected
with the procuring of provision and stores for the
besieging troops. In November, the Elector of Bavaria
besieged Brussels, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the
force which advanced to relieve the place. The strong
positions of the enemy behind the <em>Scheldt</em> were forced on
the 27th of November; and when the troops advanced
upon Brussels, the Elector of Bavaria raised the siege,
and made a precipitate retreat.</p>

<p>The citadel of Lisle, being vigorously pressed, surrendered
on the 9th of December. The period for military
operations had passed away; but notwithstanding
the lateness of the season the Duke of Marlborough
resolved to besiege <em>Ghent</em>, and the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was
one of the corps selected for this service. An attack was
made on the out-posts of the town on the night of the 24th
of December, when a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed
part of the forlorn-hope, and had several men killed and
wounded. The trenches were opened during the same
night, and the siege being prosecuted with spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
vigour, the garrison surrendered on the 2nd of January,
1709. Bruges was also vacated by the French; and the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having marched into Ghent when that
city was delivered up, remained there during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>The regiment, having reposed for a few months in convenient
quarters, and obtained a body of fine recruits
from Scotland, advanced from Bruges to the plain of
Lisle, and was afterwards encamped with the army on the
banks of the Upper Dyle. The French had constructed a
new line of entrenchments and forts: the allies advanced
with the apparent design of attacking the enemy, when
Marshal Villars drew a number of troops out of the neighbouring
garrisons, and prepared to make a determined
resistance. This was what the Duke of Marlborough
wished; and no sooner had a considerable detachment of
French troops quitted the garrison of <em>Tournay</em>, than the
allies struck their tents, marched to the left, and invested
the town. Both battalions of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
were in the besieging army, and took an active part in
the several attacks on the works, and in repulsing the
sallies of the garrison. On the 29th of July, while preparations
were making to attack the town by storm, the
governor surrendered. The citadel still held out; but five
British regiments, which had not taken part in the siege
of the town, were selected for the siege of the citadel, and
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment joined the covering army.</p>

<p>During the period the siege of the citadel of Tournay
was in progress, Lieut.-General the Earl of Orkney was
detached, with the grenadier companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
and several other regiments, and twenty squadrons of
cavalry, towards St. Ghislain, to seize on certain passes,
and to facilitate the subsequent operations of the campaign;
and the citadel having surrendered on the 3rd
of September, the army afterwards proceeded towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Mons, the capital of the province of Hainault, which the
allies intended to besiege. While the troops were on the
march, Marshal Villars made several movements with
the view to prevent the loss of Mons; and on the 10th
of September the French army was in position in front
of Taisniere and the hamlet of <em>Malplaquet</em>, and having
thrown up entrenchments and constructed <i lang="fr">abatis de bois</i>
and other defences, until their camp resembled a fortified
citadel, they there awaited the attack of the allies.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the morning of the 11th September,
the forces of the several nations which composed the
army commanded by the Duke of Marlborough and
Prince Eugene of Savoy, were under arms. The two
battalions of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment appeared on parade
on the ground where they had passed the night, and
divine service was performed by the chaplain. The
French camp was a short distance in front; but a thick
mist overspread the woods and open grounds, and concealed
the armies from each other. Under cover of the
fog, the artillery was brought forward, and dispositions
made for the attack: the French heard the din of hostile
preparations, and seized their weapons, and two powerful
armies, headed by commanders of renown, stood arrayed
against each other. The troops of both armies had confidence
in their leaders, and were anxious for the combat;
the one to acquire new laurels under their favourite chiefs,
and the other to retrieve the disasters of eight successive
campaigns. The fog lingered on the ground until about
half-past seven, when the sun broke forth. The fire of
the artillery instantly opened on both sides, and the
columns of attack moved forward, and commenced one of
the most sanguinary and hard-contested battles on record,
in which there was a greater sacrifice of life than at the
battles of Blenheim, Ramilies, and Oudenarde, put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>gether.
"It is impossible to express the violence of the
fire on either side. Besides the enemy's advantageous
situation, they defended themselves like brave men, and
made all the resistance that could be expected from the
best of troops; but then nothing could be a finer sight
than to see our foot surmount so many obstacles, resist
so great a fire, force the enemy's entrenchments, beat
them from thence, and drive them quite out of the
wood, and after all, to draw up in good order of battle
on the plain, in sight of our enemies, and before their
third entrenchments<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the division commanded
by General Count Lottum, and were engaged in the
assault of the entrenchments in the wood of Taisniere.
Two battalions of Foot Guards led the attack, and,
having overcome several local difficulties, they commenced
ascending the enemy's breastwork, but were repulsed and
driven back. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> seconded the Foot Guards;
Argyle's regiment (3rd Buffs), and several other corps,
prolonged the attack to the left; and these troops, rushing
forward with the native energy and resolution of
Britons, forced the entrenchments in gallant style, and
the French fell back fighting and retreating into the
woods. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and other corps, pressed forward:
the trees and foliage being thick, the ranks were broken;
every tree was disputed, and the wood echoed the turmoil
of battle on every side.</p>

<p>When the fighting in the wood of Taisniere, where
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were engaged, had assumed the character of
a series of skirmishes, a most sanguinary conflict was
raging in other parts of the field, particularly in the
centre, where the Prince of Orange led the Dutch infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
against the enemy's treble entrenchments, and at
the points of attack allotted to the Germans. Eventually
the enemy's position was broken, and a conflict of cavalry
ensued, in which the allies proved victorious. Meanwhile
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and other corps engaged in the
woods, continued to gain ground, and the French were
forced to retreat. The allies captured a number of prisoners,
colours, standards, and cannon; but this victory
was purchased at an immense expense of human life,
especially of Germans and Dutch. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> having
fought a great part of the day in the wood, where the
men were partly covered by the trees, the regiment did
not sustain a very severe loss. Lieutenant Haley and a
few private men were killed; and Lieutenants J. Stratton,
Dixon, and W. Stratton, were wounded<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.</p>

<p>The victory at Malplaquet was followed by the siege
and capture of <em>Mons</em>, which was terminated by the surrender
of the garrison on the 20th of October. The
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the covering army during the
siege, and afterwards marched back to Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>The regiment having passed the winter in its former
quarters, quitted Ghent on the 14th of April, 1710, and
directing its march towards the frontiers of France,
arrived at the rendezvous of the army, in the vicinity of
Tournay, on the 19th of that month. The allies, by a
forced march, succeeded in passing the French lines at
Pont-a-Verdun without opposition, and invested <em>Douay</em>.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the covering army during
the siege. The French army advanced and menaced the
allies with an attack, but retreated after a sharp cannonade,
and Douay surrendered on the 27th of June.</p>

<p>After the capture of Douay, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the direction of Aubigny, and formed part of the covering
army encamped at Villers-Brulin during the siege of
<em>Bethune</em>. This place having surrendered on the 28th
of August, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were afterwards detached from
the main army, and sent under the command of the
Prince of Anhault, to besiege the town of <em>Aire</em>, which
is situated on the banks of the river Lys. The governor
of this place made a vigorous defence; and the regiment
was sharply engaged several times in carrying
on the attacks and storming the outworks, and had
a number of men killed and wounded. The garrison
having surrendered on the 9th of November, the
regiment afterwards marched back to its former winter-quarters
at Ghent, where it arrived on the 23rd of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> again took the field towards the end of
April, 1711, and, advancing up the country, joined the
army near Douay, and were reviewed with the remainder
of the British infantry, on the 8th of June, by
the Duke of Marlborough, at the camp at Warde. On
the 14th the army advanced to the plains of Lens. The
enemy had thrown up a new line of entrenchments; and
the French army, commanded by Marshal Villars, was
posted behind these formidable works, which were deemed
impregnable. But the British commander, by menacing
the enemy's left, occasioned the French troops to be
drawn to that quarter; then, by a forced march, passed
the lines at an unguarded part at <em>Arleux</em>, and afterwards
invested <em>Bouchain</em>, a fortified town of Hainault, situated
on both sides of the river Scheldt. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed
part of a division of twenty battalions, commanded by
Lieut.-General the Earl of Orkney, which took post on
the north and north-west side of the town and river.</p>

<p>The French, by a night march, gained possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the heights of Wavrechin, from whence they expected to
be able to relieve the town; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed
part of a division of infantry which advanced to dislodge
the enemy; but the position was found too formidable to
be attacked, and the regiment retired without firing a
shot. During the night a series of works was constructed;
a causeway was also made through the deep inundations
which the enemy had, by means of sluices on the river,
caused to overflow the low grounds near the town; and
thus Bouchain was completely invested, and all communication
with the troops on the heights of Wavrechin cut
off. The siege was then prosecuted with vigour, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> took their turn of duty in the trenches, and in
carrying on the attacks, and had several men killed and
wounded. The total loss of the British troops in this
siege was 1,154 officers and men killed and wounded.
The garrison agreed to surrender on the 13th of September.
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> remained at Bouchain until the
works were repaired, and afterwards went into quarters
for the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>In the early part of April, 1712, the regiment once
more took the field, and on the 19th of that month pitched
its tents near Tournay, where the Duke of Ormond
arrived on the 9th of May, and took command of the
army, the Duke of Marlborough having, for a political
cause, been removed from his military appointments.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May the army advanced, and on the
21st encamped on the hills of St. Denis, near Bouchain;
thence proceeding across the Scheldt, arrived a few days
afterwards near the frontiers of France; and the two
grenadier companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, forming
part of a reconnoitring party, advanced a few miles into
Picardy.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Quesnoy</em> was afterwards undertaken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, forming part of the covering army,
was encamped at Cateau-Cambresis; but was not engaged
in any act of direct hostility. The garrison surrendered
on the 4th of July; and soon afterwards the Duke of
Ormond having received orders to proclaim a suspension
of arms between the British and French, preparatory to
a general treaty of peace, the British troops retreated
from the frontiers of France to Ghent.</p>

<p>The French monarch having agreed to deliver the city
of Dunkirk into the hands of the British as a pledge of
his sincerity in the negociations for peace, it was taken
possession of by six battalions from England; and on
the 4th of August, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with four other British
regiments, twenty pieces of cannon, and four mortars,
under the command of Lieut.-General the Earl of Orkney,
marched from the camp near Ghent to Dunkirk, where
they arrived on the 6th, and the regiment remained in
garrison in this city nearly two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>A treaty of peace having been concluded at Utrecht,
the British troops were ordered to return from Flanders.
Several regiments embarked in the spring of 1714; the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched from Dunkirk, in May, to Nieuport,
where they remained until after the decease of Queen Anne
and the accession of King George I., which occurred on
the 1st of August, 1714. The first battalion embarked
a few days after this event, and landed&mdash;seven companies
at Dover, and five at Greenwich and Deptford&mdash;on the
15th of August; and the second battalion landed at
Gravesend and the borough of Southwark on the 22nd of
that month. Both battalions assembled in the vicinity of
London, and having been reviewed by the Duke of Ormond,
afterwards proceeded into garrison at Portsmouth
and Plymouth.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> At the same time a reduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>of four companies took place, and the establishment of
each battalion was fixed at 10 companies, of 3 officers, 2
serjeants, 2 corporals, 1 drummer, and 36 private men
each<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>After the arrival of King George I. from Hanover, the
Protestant succession to the throne appearing to be
peacefully established, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were ordered to
proceed to Ireland, where the presence of a considerable
military force was deemed necessary to restrain the
Roman Catholics from taking arms in favour of the
Pretender. The regiment was accordingly relieved from
garrison duty at Portsmouth and Plymouth by the Third
Foot Guards, in March, 1715, and proceeded to Chester,
where both battalions embarked for Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>During the remainder of the reign of George I. and
the early part of the reign of George II. the regiment
was stationed in Ireland. In 1717 its establishment was
fixed at 22 companies, of 3 officers, 2 serjeants, 2 corporals,
1 drummer, and 38 private men each; and the
expense of the regiment was estimated at &pound;16,710 18<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>
per annum. Thus it continued for several years; but in
1727, when 10,000 men were held in readiness to embark
for Holland to assist the Dutch in the war with Austria,
an augmentation of 20 serjeants, 20 corporals, 20 drummers,
and 500 men, was added to the establishment; no
embarkation, however, took place, and the regiment was
afterwards placed upon a peace establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1737</div>

<p>In January, 1737, Field Marshal the Earl of Orkney,
who had commanded the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> nearly 45 years, and
had often led the regiment to battle and to victory, died
in London; and in June King George II. conferred the
Colonelcy on the Honorable James St. Clair, from the
22nd Regiment of Foot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>The death of Charles VI., Emperor of Germany,
having occurred in the autumn of 1740, the succession of
the Archduchess Maria-Theresa, as Queen of Hungary
and Bohemia, was disputed by the Elector of Bavaria,
and immediate signs of war appearing, an augmentation
was made to the strength of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment; and
its establishment was increased to 1628 officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>Previous to this period both battalions had usually been
employed at the same station: they were considered as
one corps, and few instances occurred of their being
engaged in separate services, even for short periods; but
on the 21st of October, 1741, while the first battalion
remained in Ireland, the second battalion, having been
placed on the English establishment, embarked at Cork
for the West Indies. It however remained in the West
Indies only a few months, and arrived in England in
December, 1742, together with the 6th, 15th, and 24th
regiments<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>. In the following year it returned to
Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st
Batt.</div>

<p>In the meantime, the French having taken part with
the Elector of Bavaria against the Archduchess Maria-Theresa,
a British force had been sent to Flanders to
co-operate with the Austrians; and in the spring of 1743
the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was ordered to
proceed from Ireland to Flanders to join the army. It
accordingly embarked from Ireland, and on its arrival at
Ostend, in June, took charge, together with three other
regiments, of the clothing for the army which had
marched from Flanders to Germany. From Ostend the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched with the clothing to Brussels, where
they arrived on the 10th of July; thence, continuing
their route for Germany, passed the Maese on the 14th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and joined the army at Hanau, a few days after King
George II. had gained a victory over the French at
Dettingen. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were afterwards engaged in
operations in the west of Germany, but returned to the
Netherlands in the autumn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>During the following year the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the army commanded by Field
Marshal Wade, and was employed in several operations
in the Netherlands; but no general engagement occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>In the spring of 1745 the French besieged Tournay;
and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the army commanded by
His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, who
advanced to the relief of the town. The French took up
a position near the village of <em>Fontenoy</em> to cover the siege;
and the Duke of Cumberland, though inferior to the
enemy in numbers, resolved to attack the position. The
army accordingly advanced to the vicinity of Tournay,
drove in the French out-posts on the 10th of May, and on
the morning of the following day moved from its camp-ground
to attack the enemy. Having passed through some
narrow defiles and broken ground, the troops deployed on
the plain in front of the enemy, and the British infantry
commenced the attack with a spirit and resolution which
overcame all opposition. But the Dutch having failed in
their attack on the village of Fontenoy, and a brigade of
infantry ordered to storm a battery above Vezont having
delayed its attack, the British infantry, which had forced
the French lines, were exposed to a dreadful cross-fire,
and were ordered to retire. A second attack was afterwards
made, with similar results: the cavalry advanced
to charge; but the failure of the Dutch on Fontenoy, and
the delay of the brigade detached against the flank battery
at Vezont, rendered a retreat necessary; and the army
withdrew from the field of battle, and halted that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
under the cannon of Aeth. Although the attack failed,
yet the army succeeded in impressing the French with a
sense of British valour and magnanimity, and the honour
of the British arms was preserved untarnished. The loss
on both sides was nearly equal; that of the first battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was 2 serjeants and 85 rank and
file killed; with Captains Thompson and Edmonstone,
Lieutenants Cockburn, Nairn, Elliott, Abernethy, and
Grant, Ensign Jones, 5 serjeants, and 178 rank and file,
wounded; also 8 rank and file missing.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were subsequently encamped with the
army on the plain of Lessines, from whence they retired
to Grammont, and afterwards occupied a position near
Brussels to cover Dutch Brabant; but the French, by
means of their immense superiority of numbers, captured
several towns in the Austrian Netherlands. In the
autumn the army went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles-Edward, the eldest son of the
Pretender, being encouraged by several chiefs of the
Highland clans, who were disaffected to the Protestant
succession, landed on the western coast of Scotland, and
was soon joined by a number of hardy mountaineers, with
whom he advanced to Edinburgh, and obtained possession
of that city. This success of the young Pretender
occasioned the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment to
be withdrawn from the Netherlands, and it arrived in the
Thames on the 25th of October. It was afterwards
ordered to form part of the army assembled in the south
of England to oppose the threatened descent of the
French.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>In the meantime the second battalion, having embarked
from Dublin on the 30th of September, 1745, had
arrived in England, and formed part of the army under
Field Marshal Wade, assembled in order to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
advance of the Highlanders into England. The rebels,
however, succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the King's
troops, and penetrated as far as Derby. The second
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was at this time in
Yorkshire; and when the young Pretender, being disappointed
of the expected aid in England, was forced to
make a precipitate retreat to Scotland, this battalion
marched in pursuit of the rebels, and arrived at Newcastle-on-Tyne
on the 24th of December. From Newcastle
this battalion marched to Edinburgh, where it
arrived in the early part of January, 1746, and was
placed under the command of Lieut.-General Hawley.</p>

<p>The young Pretender had, in the meantime, been
joined by some new levies, and having procured a supply
of artillery and ammunition, he occupied the town of
Stirling and commenced the siege of the Castle. A
few regiments having been assembled at Edinburgh, one
division, commanded by Major-General Huske, advanced
on the 13th of January and drove a party of rebels out
of Linlithgow; another division advanced to Barroustouness,
and on the 16th the whole proceeded to <em>Falkirk</em>
and encamped near the town. On the 17th, about mid-day,
the rebel army was discovered advancing towards
the high grounds on Falkirk Moor; the King's troops
quitted their camp and marched through the broken and
rugged grounds towards the enemy, and between three and
four in the afternoon the action commenced. But at this
moment a tremendous storm of wind and rain beat in the
faces of the King's troops and nearly blinded them, and
their muskets became so wet that the soldiers could not
fire. At the same time the storm beating on the backs
of the Highlanders caused them little annoyance, and
they charged their nearly blinded antagonists under such
advantageous circumstances, that several regiments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
instantly broken and driven from the ground. The reserve,
however, stood firm, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> having
rallied, joined these troops under Major-General Huske.
This body of troops made a resolute stand; the storm
had abated a little, and when the Highlanders attempted
to charge the reserve, they were assailed by a shower of
bullets, which caused them to shrink back; and they
were eventually driven up the hill with precipitation.
This division, of which the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part, maintained
its ground to the last, and remained on the field
until dark, when no enemy being in sight, and the night
being cold and stormy, the troops retired from the Moor
to their camp, and afterwards to Linlithgow, where the
soldiers, who were all dripping wet and nearly exhausted,
were put under cover, and on the following day they
marched to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Additional forces were afterwards sent to Scotland;
the Duke of Cumberland arrived at Edinburgh and
took the command; and on the 31st of January the
troops were again in motion towards the Highlanders,
who raised the siege of Stirling Castle and made a precipitate
retreat for Inverness, and one division for the
Highlands.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment also
took part in the several movements which preceded the
battle of <em>Culloden</em>, which was fought on the 16th of
April, on Culloden Moor, a few miles from Inverness.
The army had advanced on the 14th to the Royal
burgh of Nairn, about 16 miles from Inverness. During
the night between the 15th and 16th of April, the Pretender
attempted, by a forced march, to surprise the
Royal camp, but the out-posts were found alert and the
surprise impracticable, and he retreated towards Inverness,
and halted on Culloden Moor. On the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
day the King's army was discovered advancing in order
of battle, with the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
on the right of the first line, commanded by Lieut.-General
the Earl of Albemarle. The action commenced
between twelve and one, and in less than one hour the
rebel army was overpowered and chased from the Moor
with dreadful slaughter. This victory was decisive.
The young Pretender fled from the field, and after wandering
for some time in disguise amongst the isles and
mountains, he escaped to France. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, after
returning from the pursuit of the fugitive Highlanders,
pitched their tents near Inverness, where they remained
for several weeks, and afterwards marched to Perth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st
Batt.</div>

<p>The rebellion being thus finally suppressed, part of
the forces in England became disposable for other services;
and the nation being at war with France, an
attack on the French possessions in Canada was meditated;
and the first battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment,
being at this period in the south of England, was selected
to form part of the expedition, under its Colonel, Lieut.-General
the Hon. James St. Clair, which was accompanied
by a naval force under Admiral Lestock. The
fleet was, however, detained so long by contrary winds
that the attack on Canada was deferred, and an attempt
on <em>L'Orient</em>, a considerable sea-port on the north-west
of France, and the principal station for the French East
India Company's shipping and stores, was resolved upon.
The expedition sailed from Plymouth on the 14th of
September, and on the 20th a landing was effected in
Quimperle Bay, and a body of French troops were
driven from the shore. On the following day the troops
advanced in two columns towards L'Orient, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
being in the right column; some French militia fired
upon the troops from the woods, but a few skirmishers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
were thrown out, and the militia were driven back. On
arriving at Plemur the leading companies of the column
entering the village were fired upon from the houses; but
this resistance was speedily overcome, and the villagers
were punished for their temerity. On the 22nd the
troops appeared before L'Orient, when the governor
sent a flag of truce, and proposed to surrender the town
on certain conditions. These conditions were, however,
considered too favourable to the French, and they were
rejected in consequence of a report of the engineers
stating the practicability of reducing the town. The
siege was immediately commenced, the sallies of the
garrison were repulsed, and the town was set on fire in
three places by the bombs; but the expedition proved of
insufficient force for the capture of the town, and the
siege was raised on the evening of the 26th. The roads
being bad, four pieces of cannon, one mortar, and some
ammunition, were left behind; and the troops retreated
to Quimperle Bay and re-embarked without opposition.</p>

<p>In the early part of October another descent was made
on the French coast. The troops effected a landing on
the peninsula of <em>Quiberon</em>, and Lieut.-General St. Clair,
at the head of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and 42nd Highlanders,
took a fort with 18 guns, and having fortified the isthmus
the troops were cantoned in the villages and farm-houses.
The forts and guns in the peninsula, with those in the
isles of Houat and Hedic, having been destroyed, and
the country laid in ruins, the troops re-embarked and
returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>The war had, in the meantime, continued to rage in
the Netherlands, and the French, having reduced the
Austrian provinces, advanced, in April, 1747, into
Dutch Flanders, and captured Sluys and Sas van
Ghent, and besieged Hulst. The 1st battalion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Royal Regiment had, in the meantime, proceeded to
Holland, and was in cantonments in the province of
Zealand, from whence it was detached, with Bragg's
(28th) and Lord John Murray's Highland (42nd) Regiments,
under the command of Major-General Fuller, to
the relief of <em>Hulst</em>, and, having landed at Stapledyke on
the 1st of May, was employed in the defence of an
outwork called <em>Fort Sandberg</em>. On the 3rd of May the
French attacked Sandberg by storm; the Dutch made a
gallant resistance, and, on the advance of the British
brigade, the enemy was driven back. On the 5th the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were on duty in the fort, and the French, having
carried the sap along the dyke to within a few paces of
the pallisades, attacked the place by storm about nine
o'clock in the evening. The assailants advanced with all
the spirit and fury which usually distinguishes the first
attack of the French; the out-guards and piquets were
instantly forced back into the garrison, and a Dutch
regiment was disconcerted and gave way. The enemy
continued his triumphant career until he encountered the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, when a most sanguinary conflict of musketry
ensued, which was kept up throughout the night. "The
narrowness of the ground in which the battalion was
drawn up would not admit of wheeling outwards to
the right and left, as is requisite in common street-firing,
as it contained only a platoon abreast; so the
first platoon fired their 24 rounds, and then filed
off man by man, and were succeeded by the next and
following platoons, which acted in the same manner; and
what is extraordinary, all this, though in the night,
was performed without any disorder and confusion."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>The morning light had already dawned upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
scene of conflict and carnage,&mdash;between three and four
hundred officers and men of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were <i lang="fr">hors de
combat</i>; yet the survivors,&mdash;though standing amidst the
dying and the dead, and being unable to take one step
without treading on a killed or wounded man,&mdash;maintained
their ground with resolution, and continued to
pour their fatal volleys upon the enemy, who had sustained
an equal or greater loss, until five o'clock, when
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were relieved by the Highlanders; and the
French, dismayed by the sanguinary tenacity of the
defence, retreated.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In this desperate service Major
Sir Charles Erskine was killed; Lieut.-Colonel Abercrombie,
Lieutenants Forbes, Grant, Gordon, and Rutherford,
with Ensigns Campbell and St. Clair, were
wounded; and several of these officers afterwards died
of their wounds: the battalion had also about four
hundred non-commissioned officers and private men killed
and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>The fire of the French batteries being resumed with
increased fury, Fort Sandberg was rendered untenable a
few days afterwards, and the Dutch governor, General
La Roque, having resolved to vacate the Fort and surrender
the town of Hulst, the British brigade proceeded
to Welshorden, where it was attacked by the French;
but, having repulsed the enemy, it embarked in small
vessels, and, sailing to South Beveland, went into cantonments
on that island. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> appear to have
remained in South Beveland some time, and they did
not engage in any other military operation this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>In the spring of 1748 the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>Regiment, having been withdrawn from Scotland, embarked
for Holland, and joined the allied army commanded
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland,
at the camp near Ruremonde. Preliminary articles
for a treaty of peace having been agreed upon, a suspension
of arms took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<div class="sidenote">Both
Batts.</div>

<p>After the conclusion of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
the British troops were withdrawn from Holland, and both
battalions of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment proceeded to Ireland,
and were placed upon the Irish Establishment in 1749.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>On the 1st of July, 1751, a warrant was issued under
the sign manual for regulating the standards, colours, and
clothing of the army, in which numerical titles were given
to the several corps, and this was styled the "<span class="smcap">First, or
Royal Regiment of Foot</span>." The rank of the several
regiments was first established by a board of general officers
assembled in the Netherlands, by command of King
William, on the 10th of June, 1694; another board of
general officers was assembled by Queen Anne in 1713,
to decide on the rank and seniority of regiments raised
after 1694; and a third board was assembled by command
of King George I. in 1715, on the same subject. These
boards decided that English regiments raised in England
should take rank from the date of their formation, and
Scots and Irish regiments, with English regiments raised
for the service of a foreign power, should take rank from
the date of their being first placed on the English establishment.
Thus the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment obtained rank from
1661, as before stated.</p>

<p>In the warrant of 1751 the facing of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> is
directed to be <span class="smcap">Blue</span>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> "In the centre of their colours

and the crown over it; in the three corners of the
second colour, the thistle and crown. The distinction
of the colours of the second battalion is, a flaming ray
of gold descending from the upper corner of each
colour towards the centre.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>"The drums and bells of arms to have the same

the regiment under it."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>Both battalions remained in Ireland until the undetermined
limits of the British territory in North America
gave rise to another war. The colonies on the coast had
extended themselves on every side, while the Indian
trade drew many wandering dealers into the inland
country, where they found well-watered plains, a delightful
climate, and a fruitful soil. These advantages
appearing to compensate for the distance from the sea, a
company of merchants and planters obtained a charter
for a tract of land beyond the Allegany Mountains and
near the river Ohio, and commenced establishing a settlement.
The French laid claim to this part of the
country, drove away the new settlers, and built a strong
fort called Du Quesne, to command the entrance into the
country on the Ohio and Mississippi. Another dispute
had, in the meantime, occurred respecting Nova Scotia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>These aggressions on the part of the French occasioned
a body of British troops to be sent to North
America in 1755. War was declared against France in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>1756; and in May, 1757, the 2nd battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> embarked at Cork, and proceeded with the
17th, 27th, 28th, 43rd, 46th, 55th, and 58th regiments
to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, where they arrived in the
early part of July, being designed to form part of an
expedition under the Earl of Loudoun against an island
belonging to the French in the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
called <em>Cape Breton</em>. On arriving at Halifax the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were landed and formed in brigade with the 28th, 44th,
and 55th regiments, commanded by Major-General Hopson;
and the expedition was deferred until the succeeding
year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In May, 1758, the troops were again embarked, and
sailed under the orders of Lieut.-General Amherst
(afterwards Lord Amherst)&mdash;the naval force being under
Admiral Boscawen; but owing to the unfavourable state
of the weather a landing could not be effected on the
island until the 8th of June, when the troops proceeded
in boats towards the shore in three divisions. The
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Forster, formed
part of the right division under Brigadier-General Whiteman,
which proceeded towards White Point to make a
diversion, while the men of the centre division, led by
the gallant Brigadier-General James Wolfe, jumped into
the water, in the face of a tremendous fire of cannon and
musketry, hastened to the shore, attacked the French
with fixed bayonets, and drove them from their posts
in gallant style. The other divisions followed; but
the surf was so high that several boats were overset,
others were dashed to pieces, and many men were
drowned.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Louisburg</em>, the capital of the island, was
afterwards commenced; and in carrying on the approaches
the troops underwent great fatigues with a cheerful
alacrity which redounded to their honour. By their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
meritorious perseverance, and the co-operation of the
fleet, the town was taken by surrender on the 26th
of July, and with it the whole island and two other
small islands in the Gulf also surrendered. The
French garrison was made prisoners, and eleven stand of
colours were sent to England. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> lost in this
service Lieutenants Fenton and Howe, killed; with Lieutenants
Fitzsimmons, Bailey, and Ashe, and Ensign Waterton,
wounded. This conquest was considered of great
importance to the nation, and the meritorious conduct of
the officers and soldiers was rewarded with the approbation
of their Sovereign and the thanks of Parliament.</p>

<p>While the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were at Cape Breton, a body of
British troops, employed on the continent of North
America under the command of Major-General Abercrombie,
had advanced against the fort at Ticonderago,
which had been built by the French in 1756 on the west
shore of Lake Champlain; and in the attack on this
place the British troops were repulsed. Lieut.-General
Amherst, having received information of this disaster,
embarked from Louisburg on the 30th of August with
the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, 17th, 47th, and 48th
regiments, and Frazer's Highlanders, and sailed to Boston,
where he disembarked the troops, and, marching
through the woods to Lake George, joined the camp of
the forces under Major-General Abercrombie.</p>

<p>A resolution to attack the French possessions in North
America at four different points at one time was ultimately
agreed upon; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were selected to
form part of the force, under Lieut.-General Amherst,
designed to make a second attempt on <em>Ticonderago</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The troops assembled for this purpose on the east
bank of Hudson's River, about fifty miles from Albany,
in the beginning of June, 1759, where they were encamped
three weeks. Advancing from thence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
21st of June, they arrived at the banks of Lake George
in the evening, and there pitched their tents, and commenced
erecting a fort; at the same time means were
used to collect boats to convey the troops along the
lake. This occupied one month, and on the 21st of
July the regiments struck their tents, went on board the
boats, and, using blankets for sails, arrived at the second
Narrows on the following morning, and effected a landing.
Thence, advancing towards Ticonderago, the van-guard
encountered 400 French regulars and native Indians
near the saw-mills two miles from the fort, and routed
them in a few moments. The French commander, M.
Bourlemaque, had fortified a post in front of the fort,
but, when he saw the steady resolution of his opponents,
he quitted his lines, placed a garrison in the fort, and
embarked with his main body for <em>Crown Point</em>, another
fort on Lake Champlain, erected by the French in 1731.
The siege of Ticonderago was then prosecuted with
vigour, and on the 25th of July the garrison blew up
the fort and sailed to Crown Point; which place the
French commander also abandoned, and retired down
the lake to Isle aux Noix. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and other
forces afterwards proceeded to Crown Point and commenced
erecting a new fort; vessels were also built in
order to have a naval force on the lake. This work was
in progress until the 11th of October, when the large
boats, with a brigantine mounting eighteen guns and two
swivels, and a sloop mounting sixteen guns, being ready,
the troops embarked, and sailed down the lake in four
divisions; but afterwards encountering high northerly
winds, and a severe frost having set in, the expedition
was countermanded; the troops returned to Crown Point
and Ticonderago, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> proceeded to New
York for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>Meanwhile the <em>Cherokee Indians</em> had been carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
on a cruel warfare against the settlers on the frontiers of
the southern provinces of North America, and in the
early part of 1760 the two flank and four battalion companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, mustering 400 men, were ordered
to proceed, under the command of Major Frederick
Hamilton, to South Carolina, to strike a decisive blow
against the aggressors. They accordingly embarked
from New York, and, with a battalion of Highlanders
and some provincial troops commanded by Colonel
Montgomery, sailed to Charleston, and marched from
thence up the country to Fort Ninety-six, situate on the
borders of the Cherokee territory. Having halted a
short time at this place, the troops advanced on the 28th
of May, and arrived on the 1st of June at Twelve-mile
River. The scouts being unable to find any Indian
tracks, it was concluded that the Cherokees were not
informed of the march; and, although the men had
already traversed twenty miles of rugged ground that
morning, from Beaver-dams to the river, the commanding
officer resolved to push forward immediately. The tents,
waggons, and cattle, were placed in a square, a guard
was placed over them, and, just as the sun was sinking
beneath the horizon, the troops moved quietly forward
along the rugged wood-lands. After a march of sixteen
miles the detachment arrived at an Indian hamlet called
Little Keowee, and the light company of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was
ordered to surround the houses and bayonet the inhabitants.
As the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> approached the houses, a company of
Indian warriors, who were sleeping under the trees near
the hamlet, raised their usual war-cry, and opened a
scattering fire; but the soldiers&mdash;undaunted by the
dismal yell of their antagonists&mdash;fired one volley,&mdash;then,
rushing forward, encountered the Indians in close fight,
and bayoneted the whole except the women and children.
The troops then continued their route, and just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
first rays of morning began to dawn they arrived at
Estatoe, the capital of the Lower Cherokees; the town
had, however, been abandoned nearly an hour before;
but about a dozen warriors were intercepted and slain.
The town, which was found well provided with ammunition,
provision, and magazines of corn, was plundered
and laid in ashes, and many of the inhabitants who had
concealed themselves perished in the flames. This service
performed, the troops resumed their march, and
laid several other towns and villages in ashes; an act of
necessary severity, which excited painful feelings in the
breasts of the brave men who executed it. Colonel
Grant observes, in his narrative of these transactions,
published in the South Carolina Gazette,&mdash;"I could not
help pitying them; their villages were agreeably situated,
their houses neatly built and well provided,
having abundance of everything; they must be pretty
numerous, for Estatoe and Sugartown consisted at
least of two hundred houses, and every other village of
at least one hundred houses. After killing all we
could find, and burning every house, we marched to
Keowee, and arrived on the 2nd of June, after a march
of sixty miles without sleeping, at Fort Prince George,
at four in the evening." This service was performed
with the loss of four men killed, and Lieutenants Marshal
and Hamilton, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, wounded.</p>

<p>After this severe chastisement, pacific overtures were
made to the Cherokee nation, but without the desired
effect; and a second expedition into their country was
resolved upon. For this purpose the six companies of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and other troops were in motion at day-break
on the morning of the 24th of June, taking with
them six days' provision, and arrived that night at
Orkonee Creek. Thence proceeding on the following
day through woody dells and narrow tracts and chasms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
between mountains, reached War-woman's Creek in the
evening. Continuing the march on the 26th through a
country wild and rugged beyond description, the detachment
arrived on the following morning within eighteen
miles of the Indian town called Etch&ouml;ey, and the troops
proceeded forward with caution. A few horsemen marched
in front and on each flank,&mdash;the grenadiers and light
infantry scoured the thickets,&mdash;and the four battalion
companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched in the rear. Arriving
at a valley covered with trees and bushes, and
overlooked by hills on both sides, Captain Morrison and
a few men pushed forward into the thickets, and were
assailed by a straggling fire, which proved fatal to the
captain, and the next moment the woods echoed with the
dismal howlings of a thousand Indians raising their war-cry.
Undaunted by this appalling noise, the grenadiers
and light infantry rushed forward amongst the trees to
encounter the Indian warriors,&mdash;the four battalion companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> supported the attack,&mdash;while the
Highlanders pushed forward on the left to cut off the
retreat of the Indians to the hills. The savage warriors
soon gave way,&mdash;the Highlanders intercepted them in
their retreat,&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> pressed upon the rear, and
a number of Indians were slaughtered amongst the trees
on the side of the hill. The main body of the Indian
army appeared soon afterwards on the face of the mountain
on the left of the line of march, and, with frantic
gestures and horrid sounds, bid defiance to their white
adversaries. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, having gained the front of
the column, pushed forward to engage their fierce opponents
with distinguished bravery. The Indians opened
a scattering fire, and made the valley echo with their
whooping and howling; but this noise produced little
effect on the soldiers, who dashed through the bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and thick foliage with a "valour, discipline, and steadiness,
worthy of admiration;" and, although the warriors
kept up a sharp fire with their rifles for some time,
yet they eventually gave way. "The action lasted
about an hour. Captain Manley Williams, of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, was killed: he was truly a gentleman and an
extreme good officer."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had also eight
private men killed; and Captain Peter Gordon, Ensigns
Edrington and Knight, one serjeant, and thirty-two
private men, wounded.</p>

<p>The Indians fled from the field of battle towards
Etch&ouml;ey, to alarm their women and children; and the
soldiers pressing forward soon drew near the town, when
a band of warriors opened a straggling fire from amongst
some trees and then fled. The town was found deserted,
but well stored with corn. The Cherokees, finding themselves
unable to resist the troops, abandoned several other
towns and fled to the mountains. At the same time
Colonel Montgomery, having no place of safety where
he could leave his wounded men, did not advance any
farther, but retired on the 28th of June to War-woman's
Creek. The Indians, taking courage from this
retrograde movement, returned in swarms from the mountains,
and on the morning of the 29th the woods and
bushes on the line of march appeared crowded with
warriors ready to attack the troops in their retreat;
but two officers and fifty men of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
being sent out to scour the bushes on the right of the
road, and the same number of the Highlanders on the
left, they were chased from their lurking-places, and the
retreat was continued to Fort Prince George.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officer, in his despatch, observes:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>"The fatigue was immense, yet not an officer or soldier
complained. The detachment has been all along in
high spirits, judging nothing too difficult. Never did
greater harmony appear than amongst the corps of our
little army."</p>

<p>The two flank companies marched soon afterwards to
Charleston, and there embarked for New York, leaving
the four battalion companies in South Carolina under
the command of Major Frederick Hamilton.</p>

<p>The four battalion companies left in quarters at New
York, under Lieut.-Colonel Forster, had in the meantime
advanced up the country to Crown Point, of which place
the Lieut.-Colonel was appointed Commandant. Embarking
from thence on the 11th of August, the four
companies sailed, with several other corps under Colonel
Haviland, down Lake Champlain towards <em>Isle-aux-Noix</em>,
and, having landed on the 16th, encamped on the left bank
of the River Richlieu. The enemy occupied a fort near
the river; but when the batteries opened their fire against
it, the French commandant retreated with the greater
part of the garrison, leaving an officer and 30 men to
capitulate, who were made prisoners. Two other forts
were also abandoned by the French, and the Isle-aux-Noix
was taken possession of by the English. In the
meantime a British force, under General Amherst,
had proceeded to Oswego, embarked from thence on
Lake Ontario, and, sailing down the River St. Lawrence,
invaded the French settlements in Canada on that
side, and advanced upon <em>Montreal</em>. Quebec had been
captured in the preceding year; and an army, commanded
by Major-General Murray, was advancing from
thence towards Montreal. The four companies of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> and other troops, under Colonel Haviland, were
also advancing towards the same point by lake Champ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>lain
and the River Richlieu; and the whole were united
near Montreal on the 7th of September. The French
Governor, being unable to withstand the forces opposed
to him, surrendered on the following day; and thus the
conquest of Canada was effected with trifling loss. When
the French battalions laid down their arms their colours
were demanded; and their Commander answered:&mdash;"Although
the several regiments had brought with them
their colours from France, they had, finding them
troublesome and of little use in this woody country,
destroyed them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st
Batt.</div>

<p>While the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
was thus engaged in North America the first battalion had
embarked from Ireland, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Horne Elphinston, and sailed for Quiberon Bay,
on the coast of France, which station was appointed for
the rendezvous of an expedition under the orders of
Major-General Kingsley, designed for the capture of one
of the French islands in the Bay of Biscay, called Belle-Isle;
but the death of King George II. occurring (25th
October, 1760) before all the troops arrived, the expedition
was laid aside, and the battalion sailed back to
Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>The four companies of the second battalion left in
South Carolina, under Major Hamilton, were stationed at
Charleston; and, the <em>Cherokee Indians</em> having rejected
the proposed conditions for a peace, these companies,
with two of the 17th, three of the 22nd, and eight of
newly-raised provincials, proceeded up the country in
March, 1761, again to make war on the refractory
Indians. These companies encamped a short time on the
banks of the Congaree, from whence they proceeded in
May to Fort Prince George, and were joined by twenty
Chickasaw warriors from the country on the east side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the Mississippi, and by King Heigler, with twenty
Catawbas warriors. From Fort Prince George this company
of regulars, provincials, and savages, advanced in
the early part of June against the middle Cherokees,
through a most difficult country. An officer of the expedition,
in a letter published in July, 1761, observes:&mdash;"The
defiles and passes along War-woman's Creek are
horrid; on one side high and rocky mountains hanging
over our heads, the path rocky, and no wider than for
a single pack-horse; and on the other side a deep and
frightful precipice, at the bottom of which is the creek."
On the 10th of June, as the troops were on the march
along the banks of a river, the Indian army was discovered,
arranged for battle on a high woody hill on the
right of the line of march, with a straggling line of
warriors beyond the river. The Indian riflemen opened
an irregular fire, and immediately afterwards more than a
thousand warriors raised the dismal war-whoop, which
echoed in the woods and dells. This produced little
effect on the soldiers, who advanced in regular order
to engage their savage antagonists. The commanding
officer observed, in his report:&mdash;"The troops behaved
with great spirit and coolness, and by the heavy fire of
their platoons dislodged the enemy from the advantageous
posts which they had taken possession of."
The firing continued until two in the afternoon, when the
Indians were driven from their posts and fled. The loss
of the four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was three men killed;
with Ensign Joseph Knight, and six men wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the expedition continued its advance
into the Cherokee country: the Indians fled to their
mountain fastnesses; and the soldiers laid fifteen towns
and villages in ruins, destroyed the crops of corn, and
afterwards returned to Fort Prince George. This pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ceeding
convinced the Indians of their inability to resist
the King's forces, and they sued for peace, which was
accordingly granted them.</p>

<p>The other four battalion companies of the second
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, which had been
engaged in the conquest of Canada in the preceding year,
had in the meantime proceeded from Montreal, across
the country, to New York, and, leaving the two flank
companies in garrison, embarked in April, 1761, for the
West Indies, under the orders of Colonel Lord Rollo.
About this period the British government had resolved to
capture the Island of <em>Dominico</em>, which was declared
neutral by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, but
had become subject to France; and when the four companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> arrived at Guadaloupe they were
selected to form part of the expedition for this service.
Sailing from Guadaloupe on the 4th of June, the troops
soon arrived at Dominico, effected a landing on the 6th,
under a sharp fire of cannon and musketry, captured a
flanking battery, and took the town of Roseau, the
capital of the island, in a few hours. In the evening of
the same day the troops assaulted and carried the intrenchments
above the town, and captured the French
commandant and several other officers; and no further
resistance was made. Thus the whole island was reduced
with trifling loss; and Lord Rollo observed, in his
despatch:&mdash;"As to the King's troops, I cannot enough
applaud the coolness and intrepidity with which they
acted on this occasion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>Leaving Dominico in December, the four companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> proceeded to Barbadoes, where a body of
troops was assembled, under the orders of Major General
the Hon. Robert Monckton, for an attack on the
French island of <em>Martinico</em>. A landing was effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
in the early part of January, 1762, and the island
was reduced in the succeeding month. "I cannot,"
observes the general, in his despatch, "find words to
render that ample justice which is due to the valour of
His Majesty's troops which I have the honour to command.
The difficulties they had to encounter in the
attack of an enemy possessed of every advantage of art
and nature were great; and their perseverance in surmounting
these obstacles furnishes a noble example of
British spirit."</p>

<p>While the contest at Martinico was in progress, the
four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> which had been engaged
in the war with the Indians embarked from Charleston,
and sailed to the West Indies under the orders of Colonel
Grant. War had, in the meantime, been declared against
Spain; an attack on the Spanish settlements in the West
Indies had been resolved upon; and the four companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were placed under the orders of General
the Earl of Albemarle, to proceed against the valuable
settlement of the <em>Havannah</em>, in the island of Cuba.
Proceeding through the Straits of Bahama, the expedition
arrived within six leagues of the Havannah on
the 6th of June; a landing was effected on the following
day; and on the 9th the troops took up a position between
Coximar and the Moro. The Moro fort being the key-position
of the extensive works which covered the town,
the capture of this place was of great importance; and
the four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment formed part
of the force destined to make the attack on this formidable
fortress. The hardships endured in carrying on the
operations were very great: a thin soil, hardly sufficient
to cover the troops in their approaches, a scarcity of
water, and the labour of dragging the artillery several
miles over a rocky country, and under a burning sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
were happily overcome by the unanimity which existed
between the land and sea forces. The progress made in
erecting batteries, carrying forward approaches, and sapping
and mining the works, with the fire of the artillery,
having alarmed the Spanish governor, he resolved to
attempt to relieve the Moro. 1500 men were ferried over
the harbour, and they made three separate attacks on the
British line; the four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were
brought forward to sustain the posts, and the Spaniards
were repulsed, with considerable loss. The siege was afterwards
continued with vigour; two mines were sprung;
a practicable breach was made, and a detachment of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> was ordered to form part of the storming party,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
under Lieut.-Colonel Stuart, of the 90th Regiment. The
attack was made on the 30th of July. <span class="smcap">Lieut. Charles
Forbes</span>, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, led the assault, and, ascending
the breach with signal gallantry, formed his men on the top,
and soon drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts.
The garrison was taken by surprise; the Spanish commander,
Don Louis de Velasco, exerted himself to save the
fortress; and, while endeavouring to rally his men, he
was mortally wounded. The confusion amongst the
ranks of the enemy was thus augmented; nearly 150
Spaniards were killed, 400 threw down their arms and
were made prisoners, and the rest were either killed in
the boats, or drowned in attempting to escape to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>Havannah. As Lieutenants Forbes, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>,
Nugent, of the 9th, and Holroyd, of the 90th Regiments,
were congratulating each other on their success, the two
latter were killed by a party of desperate Spaniards, who
fired from the light-house. Lieutenant Forbes, being
exasperated at the death of his companions, attacked the
light-house with a few men, and put all in it to the
sword.</p>

<p>The capture of the Moro facilitated the attack on the
Havannah; and on the 11th of August a new series of
batteries opened so well-directed a fire that at two o'clock
in the afternoon the guns of the garrison were silenced,
and flags of truce were hung out from every part of the
town and from the ships in the harbour. The capitulation
was signed on the 13th, and on the following day
the British troops took possession of this valuable settlement.
Three Spanish men-of-war, with a company's
ship, were found sunk at the entrance of the harbour,
nine men-of-war were delivered up to the victors, and
two were found upon the stocks. The loss sustained by
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment in this important service was Lieutenants
Cook and Ashe, 1 serjeant, and 31 rank and
file, killed; Captain Balfour, Lieutenant Ruth, Ensign
Keating, 2 serjeants, 1 drummer, and 75 rank and
file, wounded; two rank and file missing; 3 men dead
of their wounds, and 12 from diseases arising from the
climate and severe exertions in carrying on the siege.</p>

<p>The British government having withdrawn many troops
from North America to the West Indies, the French
sent an armament across the Atlantic, and took possession
of St. John's, Newfoundland. Detachments were immediately
ordered from the British garrisons to dislodge the
enemy; and the two flank companies of the second battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having been left in North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
America, were employed in this service, under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel William Amherst. A landing
was effected, on the 13th of September, at Torbay, and the
troops gained possession of the strong post of Kitty
Vittiy. A detachment was sent to the top of a high rock
which commanded the ford, and under cover of the fire
of these men the light companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> and
Montgomery's Highlanders passed the river. The grenadiers
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> and 77th Regiments supported the
attack; and the French were driven from their post on a
hill beyond the river. Two other heights were afterwards
carried; and on the 17th, a battery being ready to open
its fire on the fort, the French commander surrendered.</p>

<p>In November of this year General the Hon. James
St. Clair died at Dysart; and the Colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was conferred on his cousin, Sir Henry
Erskine, from the Twenty-fifth Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>At the peace in 1763 the Havannah was restored to
Spain; and the several companies of the second battalion
were withdrawn from North America and the West
Indies, and sailed for England. In 1764 this battalion
proceeded to Scotland, where it remained four years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<p>Sir Henry Erskine died in August, 1765, and was
succeeded in the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment by
John Marquis of Lorne, afterwards Duke of Argyle.</p>

that important fortress for several years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1771</div>

<p>The second battalion remained in Scotland until the

for the island of Minorca, to relieve the 3rd,
11th, and 67th Regiments.</p>

Gibraltar in the autumn of 1775, and arrived in England
in December of the same year. The second battalion
was also relieved at Minorca in a few weeks afterwards,
and arrived in England in February, 1776; and
both battalions remained in Britain until the autumn of
1780.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The contest on the subject of taxation between Great
Britain and her North American Colonies having given
rise to hostilities in 1775, the insurgents were abetted by
France, Spain, and Holland. The French monarch
openly declared in favour of the rebellious colonists in
1778, the Spaniards in 1779, and a secret treaty between
the Dutch and Americans was discovered in 1780. Thus
the contest assumed a formidable character; hostile proceedings
extended from North America to the West
Indies; and in November, 1780, the first battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment embarked from Portsmouth to take
part in the contest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>On arriving in the West Indies the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> proceeded,
with other troops commanded by Major-General Vaughan,
and a naval force under Sir George Brydges Rodney, against
the Dutch island of <em>St. Eustatia</em>, which surrendered on
the 3rd of February, 1781, together with the neighbouring
isles of <em>St. Martin</em> and <em>Saba</em>. Property to an
immense amount was captured on this occasion, and a
severe blow was thus inflicted on the Dutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>The first battalion was afterwards stationed on the island
of <em>St. Christopher</em>, together with the flank companies of
the 15th, and a detachment of the Royal Artillery, which,
with a few militia, constituted the whole military force on
the island, and was commanded by <span class="smcap">Lieut.-Col. Thomas
Fraser</span> of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, "a brave old officer,"<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>acted as Brigadier-General under the Governor, Major-General
Thomas Shirley.</p>

<p>In the early part of January, 1782, a French naval
force, and a fleet of transports with an army on board,
appeared before the island; and the commander of the
British troops, being unable to oppose so formidable a
host, retired to Brimstone Hill, where he was joined by
the governor with a few militia. Unfortunately, the
principal inhabitants were in the interest of the enemy;
so much so, that twelve brass 24-pounders, two 13-inch
mortars, and a quantity of ammunition, sent from England
for their defence, were suffered, by the Council and
Assembly of the island, to lie in a useless state at the foot
of Brimstone Hill. The French Commander, the Marquis
de Bouill&eacute;, immediately landed 8000 men and a formidable
train of artillery, and advanced towards the hill
on which the garrison had taken post. The ground
occupied by the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, flank companies of the 15th,
and militia, was about 200 yards in diameter, and remarkably
strong; but the fortifications were old and in
a ruinous state, and the troops had no intrenching tools:
they, however, resolved to defend the place as long as
possible, in hopes of being relieved.</p>

<p>Although the French had so great a superiority of
numbers they did not venture to attack the little band of
stout-hearted Britons on Brimstone Hill by storm, but
commenced the siege in regular form,&mdash;breaking ground
on Sommerfall's estate on the north-west side, and on
Rawlin's estate on the old road-side. The French
artillery opened its fire on the 19th of January, and from
that day a storm of balls and bombs rattled round
Brimstone Hill with increasing fury, until the houses on
the heights were battered to pieces, and the old works
were nearly destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>During this period Rear-Admiral Hood appeared
before the island with a British naval and land force, and
a body of troops effected a landing on the 29th of
January; but the French had so great a superiority
of numbers, and they had completely surrounded Brimstone
Hill, so that these few troops could not be of
any use in attempting to save the island, and they re-embarked.</p>

<p>The fire of the French batteries had, in the meantime,
dismounted or disabled nearly all the guns on the hill;
several large breaches had also been made in the works
on the north-west side of the fort; the garrison was
reduced by sickness and other casualties to about 500
men; the want of intrenching tools rendered it impossible
for the men either to repair the damaged works
or throw up intrenchments; the provision-stores had also
been destroyed by the French batteries; and the few
remaining men fit for service had to be under arms every
night, expecting the enemy to storm the hill. Yet,
under all these disasters, the garrison evinced that valour,
firmness, and constancy, for which the British soldier has
been distinguished at periods of extreme danger and
privation.</p>

<p>At length the governor and commander of the forces
"thought they should be wanting in humanity to the
brave soldiers who had behaved so long with such
fidelity and courage if they should subject them to all
the horrors of an assault, which, from the superior
numbers of the enemy, and the ruinous condition of
the place, could not fail to succeed. They therefore
proposed a cessation of arms on the 12th of February,
for adjusting the terms of capitulation, which was done,
as the Marquis de Bouill&eacute; did not impose hard terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
on the soldiers of a garrison who had acquitted themselves
so well and had suffered so much."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The garrison marched through the breach with drums
beating and colours flying, and, having laid down their
arms, the militia proceeded to their homes, and the
regular troops were sent to England, on condition that
they should be considered as prisoners of war until
exchanged. Brigadier-General Fraser observed, in his
despatch:&mdash;"Notwithstanding the event has proved
unfortunate, I should be wanting in doing justice to
the troops under my command if I concluded without
saying that both officers and soldiers deserve the highest
commendation. Under a constant fire of shot and
shells, night and day (that I doubt has, in any instance,
been exceeded), the officers showed a constant and
universal cheerfulness, and by their example the soldiers
bore the greatest fatigue with a firmness that deserves
my acknowledgments." The loss sustained by the
battalion during this siege was, Lieutenants Wilson and
Clerk, Quarter-master Shungar, 3 serjeants, 2 drummers,
and 22 rank and file, killed; Captains Wallace
and Buckeridge, Surgeon Young, 6 serjeants, 4 drummers,
and 84 rank and file, wounded; 2 private men
missing.</p>

<p>After the capitulation the battalion proceeded to
England, where it arrived in May, and, its exchange
having been settled, it resumed military duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Both

<p>On the 9th of May, 1782, the Duke of Argyle was
removed to the 3rd Foot Guards; and the Colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was conferred on Lord Ada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>m

<p>Both battalions remained in England until the autumn
of 1783, when, peace having been concluded, the second
battalion embarked for Ireland, from whence it proceeded,
in the following year, to Gibraltar to relieve the
Hanoverian corps, which had been performing duty in that
garrison during the war. At the same time the first
battalion proceeded from England to Ireland, where it
remained until January, 1790, when it embarked for the
West Indies to relieve the 3rd Foot, and on its arrival
at its destination it was stationed at Jamaica.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>Meanwhile a revolution had broken out in France;
and in 1793 the French Monarch, Louis XVI., was
beheaded by his subjects. Anarchy, confusion, and
bloodshed prevailed in that kingdom, and the revolutionary
party sought to involve other nations in the
like horrors. War was the result. A powerful party,
with principles favourable to monarchy, still existed in
France; and, although the kingdom was governed by
republicans, who maintained their authority by the terrors
of the guillotine, yet many patriots stood forward with
boldness in the cause of royalty; and a union took place
between the cities of Marseilles, Lyons, and Toulon, in
favour of Louis XVII., which alarmed the ruling powers.
A republican army was sent against them, and Marseilles
immediately surrendered. At the same time the inhabitants
of the celebrated port of <em>Toulon</em>, the principal
station of the French navy, joined with Admiral Turgot
in proposing a negotiation with Admiral Lord Hood,
who commanded a British naval force in the Mediterranean,
and the port was taken possession of in August,
1793, by the British, in the name of Louis XVII.
The French general had no sooner obtained possession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Marseilles than he advanced against Toulon. Strenuous
exertions were made to procure troops to defend the
place: besides French loyalists and a few British troops,
detachments of Spaniards, Neapolitans, and Sardinians,
were procured, and the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment embarked from Gibraltar to take part in this
service.</p>

<p>The battalion landed at Toulon towards the end of
October, and marched on the evening of the same day to
an out-post called <em>Les Sablettes</em>, where it was partially
engaged with the enemy. Three companies were afterwards
detached to <em>Fort Mulgrave</em>, an important post on
the heights of Balaguier, which covered the town and
harbour. This post was attacked on the evening of the
15th of November by a strong body of French republicans,
who were repulsed and driven back. Lieut.-General
O'Hara stated in his despatch on this subject:&mdash;"I have
particular pleasure in mentioning that, on this occasion,
the very spirited exertions of the British troops stationed
in Fort Mulgrave, consisting of a detachment of the
second battalion of the First, or <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment of
Foot, commanded by Captain Duncan Campbell, and
of a detachment of the Royal Artillery, commanded by
Lieutenant Lemoine, were the principal means of repulsing
the enemy, and of saving that important post.
Our loss, including Spaniards, Neapolitans, and Sardinians,
amounted only to 61. Among the wounded
were Captain Duncan Campbell, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and
Lieutenant Lemoine, of the Artillery."</p>

<p>The enemy afterwards erected a battery on the heights
of <em>Arenes</em>, which much annoyed one of the principal out-posts;
and a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of
the force, consisting of 400 British, 300 Sardinians, 600
Neapolitans, 600 Spaniards, and 400 French, commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
by Major-General David Dundas, which issued from
Toulon on the morning of the 30th of November, crossed
the river, traversed the olive-grounds, ascended the
heights of Arenes, and carried the battery with signal
gallantry. British valour was conspicuous on this
occasion; but, unfortunately, an excess of ardour led to
a disastrous result. The French fled in dismay down the
hill; the British and other troops, following in full
career, passed the valley, and ascended other heights at
a considerable distance; and when out of breath, and
exhausted with the chase, they encountered a superior
body of fresh adversaries, and were forced to retreat, and
Lieut.-General O'Hara was taken prisoner. Sir Gilbert
Elliot, Bart., who was an eye-witness, observed, in a letter
to the Secretary of State:&mdash;"It is a real consolation to
know that the courage of the British was conspicuous
from the beginning of the action to the end; and that
an excess of that good quality was the true and only
cause of the miscarriage." The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> lost, on this
occasion Lieutenant M'Kellar, 1 serjeant, and 9 rank
and file, killed; Lieutenants Mackenzie and Colin
M'Donald, with 2 serjeants, 1 drummer, and 32 rank
and file, wounded; Captains Reeves and Finnay
wounded, and taken prisoners; Lieutenant Bird, 2 serjeants,
1 drummer, and 17 rank and file, missing.</p>

<p>The defence of Toulon with only 12,000 men of five
different nations, against an army of between 30,000
and 40,000 men, was found a difficult service. The
garrison had to occupy a circumference of fifteen miles,
by a number of posts, which required 9000 men for their
protection. In the middle of December the republican
army attacked the line of posts with great fury, and
forced a passage at several places. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were
engaged in the defence of <em>Fort Mulgrave</em>, and lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
1 serjeant, 1 drummer, and 18 rank and file. After
the line of posts was forced it was found impossible to
maintain the town; the French shipping, magazines, and
arsenal, were consequently set on fire, and the men of
the several nations embarked on board the fleet on the
19th of December. Detachments of the troops took part
with the seamen in the work of destruction; and Lieutenant
Ironmonger, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, is stated to have been
the last officer who quitted the dock-yard gates. With
the republican army which attacked Toulon was an
officer of artillery, named <span class="smcap">Napoleon Bonaparte</span>, who
afterwards arrived at the dignity of Emperor of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>After the evacuation of Toulon the fleet remained five
weeks in the bay of Hieres, during which time arrangements
were made for attacking the island of <em>Corsica</em>:
the fleet weighed anchor on the 24th of January,
1794, but was dispersed by a gale of wind, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> were driven to one of the ports in the island of
Elba, where they remained several days. On the 5th of
February they again put to sea, and on the evening of the
7th landed, with the 11th, 25th, 30th, 50th, 51st, and 69th
Regiments, in an open bay in the Gulf of Fiorenzo, in the
island of Corsica. On the following day the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and
51st were detached, under Lieut.-Colonel (afterwards Sir
John) Moore, with a small howitzer and a six-pounder
carried on the shoulders of a party of seamen, against Fornelli
Tower, and after traversing eight miles of rocky mountainous
country, destitute of roads, arrived at the heights
above the tower, but found the distance too great for the
light artillery to reach it; and the two battalions afterwards
retired. Batteries were subsequently erected
against <em>Convention Redoubt</em>, which was considered the
key to the works on this part of the island; and, the fire
of the artillery having produced some effect, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
commanded by Captain Mackenzie, and 51st Regiment,
moved from their camp-ground on the morning of the
17th of February to attack the advanced point of the
redoubt; at the same time the 50th Regiment marched
against the centre of the work, and the 21st proceeded
along the sea-shore; the whole commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Moore. After traversing some rocky grounds
covered with myrtle-bushes with great caution, the
troops arrived in the vicinity of the redoubt unperceived
by the enemy; then, rushing forward, entered the works,
and with their bayonets drove the French and Corsicans
down the steep hill in the rear. The enemy soon afterwards
evacuated the town of Fiorenzo, with the towers
and batteries in the gulf, and retreated to the Tower of
Tichine, situated on a high mountain between Fiorenzo
and Bastia, an important sea-port and the capital of the
island. Speaking of this event, Lieut.-General Dundas
observed in his despatch,&mdash;"The conduct of Lieut.-Colonel
Moore, of the several commanding officers, and
of the officers and soldiers under his orders, was firm
and judicious, and merits every commendation."</p>

<p>Bastia was afterwards besieged by sea and land, and
surrendered on the 22nd of May. An assembly of the
Deputies afterwards agreed to unite the island to Great
Britain, which was performed with the solemnities customary
on such occasions. But <em>Calvi</em>, a fortified town
thirty-three miles from the capital, and situated on a
tongue of land which forms one of the most beautiful
harbours in the island, still held out; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
formed part of the land force commanded by Lieut.-General
Stuart selected for the siege of this place. The
battalion accordingly embarked from Bastia, and, having
landed near Calvi on the 19th of June, took post on a
ridge of mountains three miles from the town. Owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to the numerous rocky heights and steep mountains
before the town, the soldiers and seamen had to make
roads along difficult precipices, to drag the guns up the
mountains, and to carry up materials for erecting the
batteries, which they performed with cheerful alacrity.
The fire of the heavy artillery having made a practicable
breach on the west side of the Mozello, on the 18th of
July the light infantry and <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by
Lieut.-Colonel Moore, "proceeded with a cool, steady
confidence, and unloaded arms, towards the enemy,
forced their way through a smart fire of musketry,
and, regardless of live shells flung into the breach,
or the additional defence of pikes, stormed the Mozello;
while Lieut.-Colonel Wemyss, with the Royal
Irish Regiment, and two pieces of cannon, under the
direction of Lieutenant Lemoine, equally regardless
of opposition, carried the enemy's battery on the
left, and forced the trenches without firing a shot."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The capture of these posts proved of great importance,
and, the siege being continued with vigour, the garrison
surrendered on the 10th of August. The loss sustained
by the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was very
trifling, viz., about four men killed and Captain Colin
M'Donald and seven men wounded. The battalion was
afterwards stationed in garrison at Calvi, where it remained
nearly two years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The republican principles which produced the revolution
in France soon extended to the French West
India settlements; and the inhabitants of colour in the
island of <em>St. Domingo</em> (now the black empire of Hayti),
having imbibed the doctrine of equality, rose in arms
against the whites, and carried fire and bloodshed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
the settlement. Many of the planters having, from the
distracted state of France, no hope of relief from that
country, were desirous of placing themselves under the
protection of Great Britain: a body of troops was accordingly
sent to their aid, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Whitelocke; and while the 2nd battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was engaged in the defence of
Toulon and the capture of Corsica, the 1st battalion
embarked from Jamaica and sailed to St. Domingo.</p>

<p>Much resistance was met with from the republican
troops and revolted negroes on the island. In February,
1794, the light company of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> advanced against
the fortress of <em>L'Acal</em>, in the vicinity of Leogane. Part
of the force designed for this service was embarked in
transports, and the remainder, including the light company
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, proceeded by land. The wind
proving unfavourable, the troops in transports could not
disembark; the remainder, however, advanced against
the fort,&mdash;ascended the hill, which was rendered difficult
by trees placed in all directions,&mdash;and, attacking the
enemy with fixed bayonets, drove them from their works.
After obtaining possession of the fort, two officers and
thirteen private men were killed by the explosion of a
magazine, which was fired by a negro recently from
Africa, who did not know the use of gunpowder. One
of the officers thus killed was Captain Morshead, of the
light company of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, who was wounded in
the assault of the fort. Captain Hutchinson,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, who was doing duty with the artillery, was
wounded at the commencement of the attack, but he
continued at his post of duty until the fort was carried.</p>

<p>Part of the battalion was afterwards engaged in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
unsuccessful attack on <em>Bombarde</em>, in which service sixteen
men were killed and twenty-six taken prisoners.
The attack was made before day-break in the morning,
and, the retreat being sudden, <span class="smcap">Ensign John Garston</span>,
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with eight men of his company, became
separated from the detachment, and, losing the road,
wandered in a wrong direction. Towards mid-day he
fell in with a patrol of six men of the enemy, and was
called upon to surrender; but this brave young officer
answered by a threat to fire upon them if they attempted
to interrupt him. He continued to stray farther from
his intended point; the enemy followed at a distance,
and again called upon him to surrender, but he constantly
refused. At night the patrol, fatigued with following
him over dry and sandy plains, retired. The
ensign and his little party continued to wander&mdash;fainting
with hunger, thirst, and fatigue&mdash;two days and a night,
during which time two men died of want and weariness,
having found nothing but the fruit of Indian fig-trees
and aloes. At length they arrived at a demolished port,
where they found an old fishing-boat, in which they
embarked, and arrived on the morning of the third day
at the entrance of the bay of the mole St. Nicholas, from
whence the fishermen brought them into the town.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant M'Kellar, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, who commanded
the light company after the death of Captain
Morshead, occupied an unfinished block-house near the
fortress of <em>L'Acal</em>, where he was attacked by the enemy;
but he repulsed the assailants with signal gallantry, and
his conduct on this occasion was mentioned in orders.</p>

<p><em>Port-au-Prince</em>, the capital of the French possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
in the island, was still in the power of the republicans,
and the siege of this place was resolved upon. The
flank companies of the battalion took part in this service,
and the enemy evacuated the town on the 4th of June,
and it was immediately occupied by the British troops.
Unfortunately, a malignant fever broke out in the town,
and the British lost 40 officers and 600 rank and file
within two months after the surrender of the place.</p>

<p>A detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, under Lieutenant
Clunes, formed part of the garrison of 120 men at <em>Fort
Bizzeton</em>, which was attacked on the 5th of December
by 2000 of the enemy, who were repulsed with considerable
loss. Major-General Sir Adam Williamson,
speaking of this affair in his public despatch, stated,&mdash;"Captain
Grant (13th) and his two Lieutenants, Clunes
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and Hamilton of the 22nd Regiment,
merit every attention that can be shown them. They
were all three severely wounded early in the attack, but
tied up their wounds and continued to defend their
posts. It has been a very gallant defence, and does
them great honour." The loss of this little garrison
was, one serjeant and four rank and file killed; three
officers, one serjeant, and thirteen rank and file, wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>A detachment of the battalion was engaged in the
defence of an out-post at the commencement of the year
1795; and Lieutenant Spencer was wounded, and Lieutenant
Watts killed, by the blowing up of a block-house.</p>

<p>The 2nd battalion had, in the mean time, remained in
garrison at Calvi, in the island of Corsica; but the
French having violated the neutrality of the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, and taken possession of the city of
Leghorn, directed the cannon of the fortresses against the
British shipping in the road, and seized on British property;
it was believed they had the same design against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Porto Ferrajo, in the island of Elba; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were withdrawn from Corsica in July, 1796, to take
possession of this place. Meanwhile the success of the
French arms in various parts of Europe, particularly the
victorious career of General Bonaparte in Italy, had
produced a revolution of feeling amongst the inhabitants
of Corsica. Bonaparte was a native of the island, and
the Corsicans gloried in him as a man who reflected
honour on his country; this produced a feeling of
regret that the island had become annexed to Great
Britain, and they began to plot measures to effect its
separation. It appearing evident that the cost of the
defence would exceed the advantage derived from the
possession of the island, it was evacuated in October, and
the remainder of the troops proceeded to Elba, where
the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was stationed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The 1st battalion had, in the meantime, been much
reduced in numbers by its arduous services in the island
of St. Domingo; and in May, 1797, it returned to
England, from whence it was ordered to Scotland to
recruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd

<p>The French republic had concluded a treaty of peace
with Spain, and entered into negociations with the Portuguese;
but the Queen of Portugal refused to ratify the
treaty, and agreed to receive British troops into several
ports of Portugal. The 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
was, in consequence, withdrawn in the summer of
1797 from the island of Elba to proceed to Portugal; calling
at Gibraltar, it there received drafts from the several
regiments in that garrison, and, on its arrival in the river
Tagus, it was placed in garrison at Cascaes, a small
sea-port in the district of Torres Vedras, fifteen miles
west of Lisbon, where the battalion was stationed during
the remainder of this and the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>In 1798 the 1st battalion, having recruited its numbers,
proceeded from Great Britain to Ireland; and in
the beginning of 1799 the 2nd battalion was withdrawn
from Portugal, and after its arrival in England it was
encamped on Barham Downs.</p>

<p>Bonaparte was at this period in Egypt, French troops
were also engaged in operations on the Rhine, on the
Danube, and elsewhere; and a favourable opportunity
appeared to present itself for rescuing Holland from the
power of France, into which it had fallen after the
unfortunate issue of the campaign in the Netherlands in
1794. A plan of co-operation was concerted between
Great Britain and Russia, in the expectation that the
Dutch would rise in arms against the French, and in
favour of the Prince of Orange, and, aided by the
Anglo-Russian force, would exert themselves to effect
their emancipation. The 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment was selected to form part of the expedition to
Holland, and it sailed from Deal on the 13th of August,
with several other corps commanded by General Sir
Ralph Abercombie, and, after some delay from contrary
winds, landed on the 27th on the Dutch coast, near the
<em>Helder</em>. A considerable body of French and Dutch
troops assembled near the point of debarkation, some
sharp fighting occurred, and in the evening the enemy
retreated to a position six miles in his rear. The garrison
in the Helder also abandoned its post, which was
taken possession of on the following day by the 2nd
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and the 92nd Regiment. A
numerous train of heavy and field artillery was found in
this important post; and two days afterwards the Dutch
fleet surrendered without striking a blow, and hoisted the
colours of the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p>The Dutch people did not, however, manifest a dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>position
to rise against the French; but on the 10th of
September the united French and Dutch forces attacked
Sir Ralph Abercombie's position near <em>Shagen</em>, and were
repulsed by the steady valour of the British troops. The
British commander observed in his despatch,&mdash;"It is
impossible for me to do full justice to the good conduct
of the troops." The 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment had Lieutenant Gordon and three private men
wounded on this occasion.</p>

<p>Additional forces were sent from England, and His
Royal Highness the Duke of York arrived and took the
command of the army. A Russian force also arrived;
and on the 19th of September an attack was made on
the enemy's position, but, owing to the inconsiderate
valour of the Russians, it failed. On the 2nd of October
another attack was made on the enemy's positions between
Bergen and <em>Egmont-op-Zee</em>, in which the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
had another opportunity of signalizing themselves. "The
points where this well-fought battle were principally
contested were from the sea-shore in front of Egmont,
extending along the sandy desert, or hills, to the
heights above Bergen, and it was sustained by the
British columns under those highly-distinguished
officers General Sir Ralph Abercrombie and Lieut.-General
Dundas, whose exertions, as well as the gallantry
of the brave troops they led, cannot have been
surpassed by any former instance of British valour<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>."
The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were engaged with the enemy's troops
occupying the sand-hills in front of Egmont-op-Zee,
and lost on this occasion seven private men killed,
Captains Barns and Hunter, Lieutenants Ainslie, Edmonston,
Patten, Bowe, Fraser, and Johnstone, Ensign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>Birmingham, four serjeants, and sixty-one rank and file
wounded, Lieutenant Hope wounded and taken prisoner,
and ten rank and file missing.</p>

<p>The gallant conduct evinced by the battalion on
this occasion was afterwards rewarded with the Royal
permission to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Egmont-op-Zee</span>" on its
colours.</p>

<p>The Dutch people were not aroused by these gallant
exertions on their behalf to make any attempt to deliver
themselves from the power of France; and, several circumstances,
calculated to render the expedition unsuccessful
having occurred, it was decided that, instead of
fighting for a people who were not resolved to be free,
the troops should be withdrawn from Holland. A convention
was in consequence concluded with the enemy,
and the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment returned
to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The 1st battalion was stationed during the whole of
this year in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd

<p>The 2nd battalion did not remain long on home service
before it was again ordered to embark; and it
formed part of the force under Lieut.-General Sir James
Pulteney which landed on the 25th of August, 1800, on
the coast of Galicia, in Spain, with the view of attacking
the strong fortress of <em>Ferrol</em>, a sea-port situated at the
influx of the river Javia into the extensive inlet called
the Bay of Corunna. Having made good their landing,
the troops advanced to the heights which overlook the
town; some sharp skirmishing took place, and the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> had one private soldier killed, and Lieutenant
Edmonston and one private soldier wounded. After
viewing the town and its defences, Sir James Pulteney
resolved not to lose time in attacking this place, but to
re-embark the troops and proceed to join General Sir
Ralph Abercrombie, who commanded a British force in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the Mediterranean. The united forces afterwards sailed
to <em>Cadiz</em>, and summoned the governor to surrender;
but a disease was ravaging the city at the time, and the
fleet quitted the coast for fear of infection, and proceeded
to Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>During the summer the 1st battalion quitted Ireland,
and proceeded to Scotland, where it continued during
the remainder of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>After its arrival at Gibraltar the 2nd battalion was
selected to form part of an expedition under the orders
of Sir Ralph Abercrombie, designed to drive the French
army out of Egypt; and in November it sailed from
Gibraltar to the island of Malta, where the men were
disembarked to refresh themselves after having been
many months at sea. The abundance of fresh provisions
which the island afforded, the comforts of the beautiful
city of Valetta, with the luxury of the scenery, soon
restored and reanimated the troops; and on the 20th of
December the expedition sailed for the Bay of Marmorice,
in Asiatic Turkey, where the fleet arrived in
nine days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>Here the troops remained for several weeks, in a bay
surrounded by mountains, which presented to the eye
the most picturesque scenery imaginable; the regiments
were successively disembarked and exercised; Turkish
horses were purchased for the cavalry; gun-boats were
procured to cover the landing of the troops in Egypt,
and a plan of co-operation was arranged with the Turks.
The delays of the Turks detained the fleet some time;
but on the 23rd of February, 1801, it again put to sea,
when a gale of wind dispersed the Greek and Turkish
vessels. The British continued their course, and having
arrived on the 1st of March off the celebrated city of
Alexandria, the ancient capital of Egypt, they bore down
at sunset into the bay of <em>Aboukir</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>The 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was formed in brigade
with the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 54th, and the
92nd Highlanders, commanded by Major-General Coote,
and formed part of the van-guard of 5000 men, which
entered the boats on the morning of the 8th of March,
to effect a landing. At nine o'clock the boats moved
forward, and as they approached the shore, the French
troops poured down a shower of shot, shells, grape, and
musketry, which cut the surface of the water into deep
furrows, and sank several of the boats. Yet the undaunted
Britons pressed forward;&mdash;the reserve leaped
out of the boats on the shore and formed as they advanced;&mdash;the
23rd and flank companies of the 40th
rushed up the heights in the face of dangers and difficulties
sufficient to intimidate ordinary men;&mdash;the 28th
and 42nd also formed and mounted the position;&mdash;while
the Foot Guards and 58th prolonged the attack;&mdash;and
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and 54th pushed forward to sustain their
brave companions in arms. A column of French infantry
advancing through a hollow way with fixed bayonets
against the left flank of the Foot Guards, encountered
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and 54th; the British pressed forward
to engage their antagonists with their characteristic
ardour; the French hesitated, fired a volley, and then
retreated; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and 54th continued their
advance. The regiments, which first ascended the
enemy's position, had already gained considerable advantage,
and when the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> reached the heights and
joined in the attack, the French retreated. They, however,
maintained a scattered fire from the rear sand-hills
for about an hour and a half, when they were obliged to
retreat, with the loss of eight pieces of cannon and many
horses. Sir Ralph Abercrombie expressed his approbation
of the conduct of the troops in general orders in
the following terms:&mdash;"The gallant behaviour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
troops in the action of yesterday claims from the Commander-in-Chief
the warmest praise that he can bestow;
and it is with particular satisfaction that he
observed their conduct marked equally for ardent
bravery, and by coolness, regularity, and order." The
loss of the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was&mdash;Lieutenant
Lyster, 1 serjeant, and 11 rank and file,
killed; Captain&mdash;&mdash; M'Donald, Lieutenants Graham
and Fraser, 3 serjeants, and 40 rank and file, wounded.</p>

<p>In the evening after the action the victorious troops
advanced three miles on the road towards Alexandria;
on the 10th they advanced three miles further, and,
owing to the depth of the sand, the men were three
hours proceeding that short distance. On the 12th they
encamped near Mandora Tower, and on the succeeding
day marched through the wood of date-trees to attack
the enemy on the ridge of heights in front. Some sharp
fighting occurred, and the French were driven from their
position, and forced to retreat over the plains to their
lines on the heights before Alexandria. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
lost during this day's service 4 men killed and 21
wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the British troops took up a position
with their right to the sea, and their left to the
canal of Alexandria; and the Arabs visited the camp
and brought sheep, goats, fowls, eggs, and everything
the country afforded, and appeared happy to engage in a
friendly intercourse with their deliverers. On the 19th
500 Turkish troops arrived and encamped three miles in
the rear of the army. The French at <em>Alexandria</em> having
been increased in numbers by troops from the interior,
advanced on the 21st of March to attack the British,
and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had another opportunity of acquiring
laurels on the distant shores of Egypt. The battalion,
being on the right of the 1st brigade, had its post in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
centre of the front line, on the left of the Foot Guards.
As soon as the day dawned a column of French grenadiers
advanced, supported by a heavy line of infantry, to
assault this part of the position. The Foot Guards threw
forward a line of skirmishers; these being driven in, and
the French column near, the brigade opened its fire with
great precision. The enemy attempted to turn the left
flank of the Guards, but was checked; and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>,
with the remainder of their brigade, coming forward at the
moment to engage the enemy, the French grenadiers were
driven from their ground and forced to retreat. A crowd
of French sharp-shooters afterwards advanced against the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> and other regiments at this part of the field,
and the French artillery played incessantly. But the
British stood their ground manfully, and repelled the
attacks of the enemy with a constancy and valour which
redounded to their honour. The French were repulsed
at every point of attack, and forced to retreat; and at
10 o'clock <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the action ceased. The splendour of
the victory was, however, clouded with the fall of the
British commander, Sir Ralph Abercrombie, who was
wounded in the action and died a few days afterwards.
The loss sustained by the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment was&mdash;9 rank and file killed; with Captain
Goodson, Lieutenants Gordon, M'Pherson, and Johnstone,
1 serjeant, and 68 rank and file, wounded. Four
days after the battle, between five and six thousand
Turks arrived. Soon afterwards a body of British and
Turks traversed the country to the city of <em>Rosetta</em>,
situated near the mouth of one of the great channels of
the river Nile, a place distinguished by the beauty of its
environs, being completely embosomed in a grove of
date, banana, sycamore, orange, lemon, and pomegranate
trees, while the lofty palm-tree, towering over all, added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
magnificence to the landscape. This place was soon
captured; but the fort of St. Julian held out, and,
while the siege was in progress, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> marched
across the country to <em>Hamed</em>, on the Nile, five miles
above Rosetta, where they arrived on the 12th of April.
A small force of British, Turks, and Greeks, assembled
at this place, to cover the siege, several skirmishes
occurred, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had two drummers and eight
private men killed.</p>

<p>After the surrender of St. Julian, General Hutchinson,
who commanded the British forces in Egypt, having
left a body of troops before Alexandria, advanced with
the remainder, on the 5th of May, along the banks of
the Nile, through a rich country, abounding in rice,
sugar, wheat, barley, and other necessaries and luxuries
of life, and on the 7th of May drove the French from
the post of <em>El-Aft</em>. He also forced the enemy to quit
their fortified post at <em>Rahmanie</em>, and to retire through
the desert to the city of <em>Cairo</em>, the metropolis of modern
Egypt. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had three men wounded in the
skirmish near Rahmanie. The British and Turks continued
their route along the banks of the Nile, and arrived,
on the 1st of June, within sight of the Pyramids.
On the 8th they encamped within a few miles of these
stupendous structures, where they halted several days;
then advanced to <em>Cairo</em> and commenced the siege of the
city, and in a few days the French surrendered the place.</p>

<p>The capture of the capital of Egypt added additional
lustre to the British arms; and the brave men, whose
skill and prowess gained these honours, were rewarded
with the approbation of their Sovereign and the thanks
of Parliament. From Cairo the British and Turks
retired down the Nile, and proceeded to the vicinity of
<em>Alexandria</em>, and, having driven in the French out-posts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
besieged the city, which was surrendered in the beginning
of September. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had one serjeant and seven
private men killed before Alexandria, and also sustained
considerable loss from the effects of fatigue and climate.</p>

<p>The nations of Europe had witnessed with anxiety the
progress of this important struggle, and, when the veterans
of France were overpowered, the dawn of liberty
appeared above the distant horizon.</p>

<p>The British troops having, by a display of gallantry
and heroism which exceeded the most sanguine expectations
of their country, overcome the boasted "<em>Invincible</em>"
legions of Bonaparte, and forced the French
"<em>Army of the East</em>" to evacuate Egypt, from whence
its ambitious and tyrannical leader had vainly imagined
he should be able to extend his conquests throughout
Asia, King George III. conferred upon the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and
other corps, which had thus exalted the military fame of
Great Britain, the honour of bearing on their colours the
<span class="smcap">Sphynx</span>, and the word "<span class="smcap">Egypt</span>," as a distinguished
mark of His Majesty's royal approbation of their
conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The 1st battalion had, in the meantime, marched
from Scotland to England; and it sailed on the 1st of
January, 1801, from Portsmouth for the West Indies,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Nicholson. A
combination had been entered into by the courts of
Sweden, Denmark, and Russia, to support the principles
of an armed neutrality, contrary to the stipulations of
treaties, and injurious to the interests of Great Britain;
orders were in consequence issued for the attack of the
Swedish and Danish islands in the West Indies; and
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> joined the expedition, commanded by Lieut.-General
Thomas Trigge, at the island of St. Bartholomew,
on the 22nd of March. On the 24th the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
made good their landing on the Danish island of <em>St.
Martin</em>. After landing, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the 11th and
2nd West India regiments, proceeded to the French
quarter and took possession of Lee Hill, which commanded
Fort Chesterfield. The artillery was dragged
up the heights, and preparations made for commencing
the attack, when the governor surrendered.</p>

<p>One wing of the battalion, and a detachment of the
Royal Artillery, were left at St. Martin's under Lieut.-Colonel
Nicholson, who was appointed to the command
of the troops and the charge of the administration of the
island. The other wing, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
J. C. Cowell, proceeded with the expedition to the island
of <em>St. Thomas</em>, which surrendered, together with <em>St.
John</em>, and their dependencies, on the 28th of March;
and on the 31st of the same month the Danish island of
<em>Santa Cruz</em> was taken. The battalion was then stationed,
half at the island of St. Martin, and half at St.
Thomas.</p>

<p>In August, 1801, General Lord Adam Gordon died,
and was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, from
the 7th Royal Fusiliers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>In November of the same year the 2nd battalion was
withdrawn from Egypt, and proceeded to the island of
Malta, where it remained upwards of four months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The victories gained by the British troops in Egypt,
the West Indies, and other parts of the globe, were followed
by a treaty of peace, which was concluded at
Amiens; and in May, 1802, the 2nd battalion of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment proceeded from Malta to Gibraltar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>It quitted Gibraltar in the beginning of 1803, and
proceeded to England. Soon after its arrival the war
again broke out, and it was ordered to the West Indies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
where it arrived in June. It was inspected at Barbadoes
by Lieut.-General Greenfield, and immediately
afterwards proceeded with an expedition against the
French island of <em>St. Lucia</em>. The 1st division, consisting
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and two field-pieces, landed on the island
in the afternoon of the 21st of June, under the orders of
Brigadier-General Brereton. The other corps followed;
the French out-posts were driven in, and the town of
Castr&eacute;es taken possession of. On the following morning,
before daylight, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and 64th regiment advanced
to attack the strong post of <em>Morne Fortun&eacute;</em> by
storm. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> led the assault in gallant style;
the redoubt was carried with fixed bayonets, and the
enemy immediately surrendered. On the same day
Lieut.-General Greenfield issued a general order, in
which he stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Commander of the Forces has the honour to
congratulate the troops under his command on the
gallant attack and capture of the fortress of Morne
Fortun&eacute;, and the unconditional surrender of the island
of St. Lucia.</p>

<p>"He shall have particular satisfaction in reporting to
the King the readiness with which the troops forming
the expedition were embarked on the shortest notice:
he must, in particular, speak of the gallant behaviour
of the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>."</p>

<p>The loss of the battalion on this occasion was 1 serjeant,
and 8 rank and file, killed; Lieut.-Colonel Macdonald,
Captain Chaloner, 2 serjeants, and 43 rank and
file, wounded; and 1 rank and file missing. Both the
officers afterwards died of their wounds.</p>

<p>As a mark of His Majesty's approbation of the signal
gallantry evinced by the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> on this occasion, they
were permitted to bear the words "<span class="smcap">Saint Lucia</span>" on
their colours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of St. Lucia the expedition proceeded
to <em>Tobago</em>, where it arrived on the 30th of June.
The troops landed without opposition, and marched in
column towards Scarborough; the French governor,
General Berthier, was summoned, and he surrendered
the island on the same day. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were afterwards
stationed at the island of Tobago for several
months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The first battalion, which had been in the West Indies
since 1801, was employed in 1803, under Lieut.-General
Greenfield, in capturing the islands belonging to the
Batavian republic. <em>Essequibo</em> and <em>Demerara</em> surrendered
on the 20th of September, 1803; and the
island of <em>Berbice</em> surrendered to Lieut.-Colonel Robert
Nicholson, of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, on the 23rd of that month,
when the Batavian garrison, of upwards of 600 men, was
made prisoners.</p>

<p>While the first and second battalions were in the West
Indies two additional battalions were embodied at Hamilton,
in North Britain, on the 25th of December, 1804,
and added to the establishment of the <span class="smcap">First</span>, or <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment of Foot, which now consisted of four battalions,
all fit for active service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<div class="sidenote">4th

<p>Soon afterwards the fourth battalion marched to Stirling
Castle, and, after doing duty there a short time, embarked
for Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd

<p>In May, 1805, the third battalion marched from
Scotland to the south of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In February of the same year the two flank companies
of the second battalion were detached from Tobago, for
the defence of the island of Antigua; and the battalion
companies embarked for the defence of Trinidad; and in
July the whole returned to Tobago, where the battalion
remained until November of the same year, when,
after transferring its effective non-commissioned officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
drummers, and private men to the first battalion, it
embarked for England, and landed in January, 1806, a
mere skeleton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th

<div class="sidenote">3rd

<p>This year (1806) the fourth battalion quitted Ireland,
and on its arrival in England it was quartered at
Horsham, and afterwards at Bexhill barracks. The
third battalion was also stationed, during the winter of
the same year, at Bexhill barracks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd

<p>In the meantime information arrived in England of
the revolt of two battalions of Sepoys, in the service of
the East India Company, at Vellore, and of their attack
on a few companies of the King's troops at that place in
July, 1806; also of the alarming spirit of insubordination
evinced by the native troops in other parts of India; and
the second battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was immediately
ordered to embark for India, to strengthen the
European force in that country. When the order
arrived the battalion only mustered about 500 men;
but it was completed in twenty-four hours to 1000, by
volunteers from the third and fourth battalions, then
at Bexhill barracks. On the 17th of April, 1807, it
embarked at Portsmouth in six China ships, under the
orders of Lieut.-Colonel A. Stewart, arrived off the west
coast of the Malay peninsula in September following, and
landed on the 18th of that month on the Prince of
Wales's Island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd

<p>The third battalion had in the meantime proceeded to
the island of Jersey, from whence it embarked, in September,
for Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th

<p>The fourth battalion, consisting, after it had transferred
its service-men to the second, of about 40 rank and file,
embarked in April of the same year at Portsmouth, for
Scotland; arrived at Glasgow on the 29th of that month,
and commenced recruiting its numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>While the second battalion remained at the Prince of

November it embarked for the continent of India, landed
at Madras in December, and, marching into the interior,
was stationed at Wallajahbad and Bangalore, where
it remained until March, 1808, when it returned to
Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The resistance of the Portuguese and Spaniards to the
tyrannical government of Napoleon had, in the meantime,
occasioned a British force to be sent to their aid;
and Portugal had been freed from the power of France.
Spain was overrun by the legions of Napoleon; the
Spaniards were rising in arms in every quarter; and a
British force was ordered to their aid, under the command
of Lieut.-General Sir John Moore. The third
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was selected to form
part of this force; and it accordingly embarked at Cork
in September, 1808, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Andrew Hay,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and sailed for Spain with a body
of troops under the orders of Lieut.-General Sir David
Baird. These troops landed at Corunna in October, and
marched up the country; at the same time another
British force was advancing into Spain from the frontiers
of Portugal, under Sir John Moore; and a junction was
effected on the 20th of December at Majorga, from
whence the united forces advanced on the following day
to Sahagun, in the province of Leon. The Spaniards
had, however, been defeated and dispersed; and the few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>troops under Sir John Moore were unable to cope with
the overwhelming numbers with which Napoleon advanced
to attack the British army. A retreat was
consequently resolved upon; and the third battalion of
the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment shared with the other corps in all
the fatigues and privations consequent upon a retrograde
movement, continued for a distance of 250 miles, along
roads covered with snow, over mountains and rivers, and
through narrow defiles, with an enemy above three times
as numerous as themselves following in full career, and
frequently skirmishing with the rear-guard. Yet such
was the ability of the British commander, and the
native energy and resolution of the troops, that this
retrograde movement was successfully executed, and in
the middle of January, 1809, the army arrived, unbroken,
in front of <em>Corunna</em>. Napoleon, having been
foiled in his object, had desisted from the pursuit; but
he had detached a large body of troops, under Marshal
Soult, to pursue the British to the sea-shore; and a
general engagement was fought on the 16th of January,
when the British were victorious. The third battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment was formed, on this occasion,
in brigade with the 26th (Cameronians), and the second
battalion of the 81st, under Major-General Manningham,
in the division commanded by Sir David Baird. Before
the action commenced, Captain Rowan was sent forward
with 100 men of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and joined the 81st
Regiment, which had also been posted in advance. On
the approach of the enemy this party was attacked by
very superior numbers, and Captain Rowan brought
back very few of his men. When the enemy approached
Sir David Baird's division, it did not wait to be attacked,
but advanced under a heavy fire to meet its opponents;
on no occasion was the valour of British troops more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
manifest, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the remainder of their
brigade, were thanked in general orders for their gallant
conduct. This victory was, however, purchased at the
expense of many valuable lives; and the death of Sir
John Moore, who was killed by a cannon-ball, was an
irreparable loss to his country. The British troops
afterwards embarked at Corunna, and returned to England.
When the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> arrived in England, it was
discovered that they had sustained, in killed, wounded,
missing, and death from fatigue, a loss of about 250
men: and their gallantry was rewarded with the Royal
permission to bear the word <span class="smcap">Corunna</span> on their colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>This year (1809) the 2nd battalion marched, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel H. Conran, from Fort
St. George, Madras, to take the field. Previously to
quitting this station the following order was issued by
the Governor-General in Council:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the march of the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
from the garrison of Fort St. George, Lieut.-Colonel
Conran will assume the command of the force under
the orders of march to the ceded districts, without
interfering with the command of the troops in the
centre division of the army.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General in Council is pleased to express
his entire approbation of the conduct of the 2nd
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> while they have been stationed
at Fort St. George.</p>

<p>"The Governor-General in Council requests Lieut.-Colonel
Conran will accept the expression of his
warmest thanks for the able and satisfactory manner in
which he has conducted the duties incidental to the
command of the troops in the garrison of Fort St.
George."</p>

<p>After the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had been in the field a short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
they were separated, and one wing proceeded to Hyderabad,
and the other to Masulipatam, a considerable sea-port
in the district of Condapilly, where they remained
during the succeeding year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>The 3rd battalion had, in the meantime, been selected
to form part of an expedition to Holland, under the
command of the Earl of Chatham, for the purpose of
destroying the enemy's shipping, arsenal, &amp;c., on the
Scheldt. It accordingly embarked from Portsmouth in
July, under the command of Major Gordon, and landed
at <em>Walcheren</em>, one of the Dutch islands in the German
ocean, situated at the mouth of the river Scheldt, and
was engaged in the siege of <em>Flushing</em>, the capital of the
island. On the 7th of August the enemy issued from
the town, and attacked the British troops. "Their
principal effort was directed against the small wood on
the left of our advanced piquet on the dyke; and
their left column advanced towards that point in a
heavy mass, attempting to deploy while they entered
the small meadow which lies between the two woods.
Here they were received with a most destructive fire
by the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, posted on the dyke, and were gallantly
charged by the light company of that regiment."
These gallant exertions being seconded by the 5th and
35th regiments, and two six-pounders, the enemy fell
back, having sustained very considerable loss.</p>

<p>An attempt was afterwards made to drive the enemy
from their posts in front of the advanced piquets. "The
3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> advanced along the sand-hills;
and the light company of that battalion, under
Captain Hay, charged the enemy most gallantly. Very
little resistance was made, and the enemy retired into
the suburbs of the town, to which they set fire. They
had with them two small field-pieces, one of which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
taken in a most gallant manner by Lieutenant Jackson
and thirty men of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The Commander
of the Forces expressed his approbation of the conduct of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> on this occasion, in general orders, and attributed
the success principally to the rapid and gallant
charge made by Captain Hay with the light company at
the moment of the enemy's deployment.</p>

<p>The siege was afterwards prosecuted with vigour, and
the town surrendered on the 15th of August. After the
capture of this place, the expedition prepared to carry
the original design into execution; but the enemy had,
in the meantime, removed his shipping higher up the
Scheldt, and collected so large a body of troops for the
defence of Antwerp, that further proceedings were
abandoned, and the troops returned to England. The
loss of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> in this expedition was&mdash;Lieutenant
M'Lean, 1 drummer, and 8 private men, killed; Captain
J. Wilson, Lieutenants Jackson and M'Kenzie, 7
serjeants, and 81 rank and file, wounded; and 6 rank and
file missing. The unhealthy climate of Walcheren, however,
produced a much greater loss from disease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The 1st battalion had continued in the West Indies,
and was stationed at Demerara and Tobago, from whence
fifty men were detached, under the command of Captains
Lynch and Mullen,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to form part of an expedition under
Lieut.-General Sir George Beckwith, K.B., against the
island of <em>Guadaloupe</em>. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> formed part of the
2nd battalion of light infantry, under Lieut.-Colonel David
Stewart, of the 8th West India Regiment. A landing
was effected on the 28th of January, 1810, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span><span class="smcap">Royals</span> took part in the operations, by which the enemy
was forced to surrender the island in the early part of
February. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had 3 rank and file killed, and
1 serjeant and 12 rank and file wounded, in this service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>A British army was at this period in Portugal, under
the command of Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley;
and the 3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, having,
after its return from Walcheren, been recruited to 1000
rank and file, embarked at Portsmouth in February,
1810, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Barns,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> for
Portugal. After landing at Lisbon it joined the army
under Sir Arthur Wellesley, and formed part of Major-General
Leith's division. Marshal Massena was advancing
from Spain with an immense army, and he
vaunted that he would drive the English into the sea.
The British and Portuguese troops man&#339;uvred to retard
the advance of the enemy, and in September the army
took up a position on the rocks of <em>Busaco</em>. This position
was attacked by the enemy on the 27th of September;
a desperate engagement ensued, and the British,
by astonishing efforts of valour, overcame their antagonists,
and stood triumphant on the lofty heights. Sir
Arthur Wellesley, in his despatch, stated,&mdash;"Major-General
Leith reports the good conduct of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>;" and the royal permission was afterwards
obtained for the regiment to bear the word <span class="smcap">Busaco</span> on
its colours, in commemoration of the good conduct of the
battalion in this engagement.</p>

<p>The army afterwards retired to the lines of <em>Torres
Vedras</em>, where a series of works constructed with skill
opposed an insurmountable barrier to the progress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
enemy. The French Marshal, after reconnoitring the
works, retired to Santarem, and the two armies confronted
each other during the remainder of the year.</p>

<p>The 4th battalion proceeded, in August of this year,

in the West Indies; and the 2nd battalion passed the
year at Hyderabad and Masulipatam, in the East Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In the early part of 1811<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> the left wing of the 2nd
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment proceeded by forced
marches from Hyderabad to Masulipatam, where it
joined the right wing, in the expectation of embarking
with the expedition commanded by Lieut.-General Sir
Samuel Auchmuty, against the Dutch island of Java.
The battalion mustered 1036 rank and file, and the
officers and men panted for an opportunity to signalize
themselves; but, to their great regret, the order for their
embarkation was countermanded. They remained at
Masulipatam until July, when they proceeded to Trichinopoly,
a strong city in the Carnatic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>The 3rd battalion remained opposed to the French
army in Portugal. Marshal Massena occupied his
position at Santarem until his numbers were reduced by
sickness and privation, and on the night of the 5th
March, 1811, he retreated towards the frontiers. The
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, moving forward with the army, took part in the
operations which followed; the French retired into Spain,
leaving a garrison in Almeida, which was blockaded by
the allies. Having crossed the frontiers, the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
were engaged on the 5th of May at <em>Fuentes d'Onor</em>,
on which occasion the French Marshal was defeated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
his attempt to relieve Almeida. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had one
serjeant and 8 rank and file wounded in this action.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>This battalion was also before the strong fortress of
<em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, when it was besieged by the allied
army in January, 1812, and captured by storm on the
19th of that month.</p>

<p>On the 11th of February, 1812, "His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent was pleased, in the name and on the
behalf of His Majesty, to approve of the <span class="smcap">First,
or Royal Regiment of Foot</span>, being in future
styled, <span class="smcap">The First Regiment of Foot, or Royal
Scots</span>."</p>

<p>From the province of Leon the 3rd battalion marched
towards Spanish Estremadura, and was before the city of
<em>Badajoz</em> when that fortress was besieged and taken by
storm in the month of April; in which service the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> had two officers wounded; namely, Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>s
Rea and O'Neil, who were attached to the engineer's
department.</p>

<p>After the capture of Badajoz the battalion proceeded
with its division (the 5th) towards Ciudad Rodrigo, and
advanced upon Salamanca, which city the French were
forced to evacuate in the middle of June. The enemy
retreated beyond the Douro, and part of the allied army
advanced to Trabancos. The French subsequently re-passed
the Douro, when the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, with the
remainder of the division, advanced to <em>Torrecille de la
Orden</em>, to cover the retreat, and insure the junction of
the corps in advance. On the 18th of July the French
army commanded by Marshal Marmont pushed forward,
some sharp skirmishing occurred, and the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were
partially engaged, and had two men wounded. The
allied army afterwards retreated, and took up a position
on the rocky heights near <em>Salamanca</em>.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of July, while the French army was
man&#339;uvring and extending to the left, the British commander
commenced the attack at a favourable moment.
The 3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, with the remainder
of the 5th division, formed behind the village of
Arapiles; and, advancing from thence, attacked the
enemy in front with distinguished bravery, and, engaging
in a fierce combat of musketry, drove the French from
one height to another. Lieut.-General Leith, commanding
the division, was carried out of the field wounded.
Lieut.-Colonel Barns was severely wounded while leading
the battalion to the charge, and obliged to withdraw, and
the command of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> devolved on Major
Colin Campbell. The battalion continued to press forward,
and forced the legions of Napoleon to give way.
A decisive victory was ultimately gained; and the
valour of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> was rewarded with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Royal permission to bear the word <span class="smcap">Salamanca</span> on their
colours. Major Campbell signalized himself at the
head of the battalion after the fall of Lieut.-Colonel
Barns, and was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel
in the army. The loss of the battalion in action was,&mdash;Lieutenant
Neils Falks, 1 serjeant, and 22 rank and
file, killed; Lieut.-Colonel Barns, Captain Logan,
Lieutenants Kellett, O'Neil, M'Killigan, and Clark,
Ensign Stoyte,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> 7 serjeants, 2 drummers, and 120
rank and file, wounded. Volunteer M'Alpin, who was
attached to the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, was also wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the battalion advanced with the army
to Madrid, and was present at the surrender of the Retiro
on the 14th of August. From Madrid the battalion proceeded
to <em>Burgos</em>, where it remained during the siege of
that fortress, in which Lieutenant Rea of the regiment,
who was acting as engineer, was again wounded. When
the British Commander found himself unable to withstand
the overwhelming numbers which were advancing
against him, he retired, and while on the retreat the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were detached to <em>Palencia</em>, to protect the
men employed in the destruction of the bridges over the
Carrion. The enemy assembled a considerable force at
this point, and Lieut.-Colonel Campbell retreated to
Villa Muriel; the battalion was sharply engaged during
this day's man&#339;uvres, and had 2 serjeants and 6
rank and file, killed; 1 serjeant and 7 rank and file
wounded; and 1 serjeant and 26 rank and file missing.
The retreat was continued to the frontiers of Portugal,
where the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> passed the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>During this contest the tyrannical decrees published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
by Napoleon, with the view of destroying the commerce
of Great Britain, had occasioned the government to issue
orders in council respecting the trade of neutral nations,
for the purpose of counteracting the intentions of the
French Emperor. The enforcing of these orders, and the
pressing of British seamen on board of American ships,
eventually brought on a war between the British Crown
and the United States of North America; and the 1st
battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> was withdrawn from the
West Indies, where it had been stationed since 1801,
to strengthen the British force in Canada. Five companies
and the head-quarters embarked from Demerara<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
on the 24th of April, and sailed for Barbadoes. During
their passage a remarkable eruption of Mount Souffre, in
the island of St. Vincent, took place on the 1st May, when
a total darkness ensued, which continued for nearly six
hours, accompanied by a fall of volcanic ashes which
covered the decks and rigging of the vessels. The five
companies stationed at Tobago and Berbice had previously
arrived at Barbadoes; and on the 24th of June
the whole battalion, mustering 1094 rank and file, under
the command of Major John Gordon, sailed in seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>transports for Quebec. During the passage one of the
transports was captured by an American frigate; but
it was afterwards allowed to proceed on its voyage on
conditions of not serving against the United States until
regularly exchanged. In the early part of August the
battalion arrived at Quebec; and on the 14th of that
month the flank companies, under Major Gordon, and
a detachment of the Royal Artillery with a light three-pounder,
proceeded in bateaux to Point Levi, but returned
to Quebec towards the end of the same month.</p>

<p>In the beginning of September the flank companies
sailed up the St. Lawrence to Montreal, and proceeded
from thence to Chambly, a fort on the river Sorel,
which issues from Lake Champlain. In November the
head-quarters and five battalion companies marched,
under the command of Major Gordon, for St. John's;
but on their route they received orders to proceed direct
to Montreal, to resist the threatened attack of an American
force under General Dearborn. The plans of the
enemy were disconcerted, and General Dearborn retreated
without making the attack, when the five companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> proceeded to their original
destination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>The 2nd battalion, in the East Indies, remained at
Trichinopoly; and in July, 1812, four companies,
commanded by Captain John Gordon, were ordered to
suppress a mutiny amongst the Company's native troops
at Quilon, which then threatened most serious consequences
to the British possessions in India. After performing
this service, the four companies returned to their
former quarters at Trichinopoly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st
Batt.</div>

<p>Three of the companies and the head-quarters of the
1st battalion in Canada were withdrawn from St. John's
in April, 1813, to Montreal, where two other companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
also arrived from Quebec. Soon afterwards an attack
on the American post at <em>Sackett's Harbour</em>, on Lake
Ontario, was resolved upon; and 2 serjeants and 25
rank and file of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were placed under
the orders of Colonel Baynes, to take part in this
service. The grenadier company was also ordered from
Chambly to engage in the expedition; but before
its arrival, the other troops sailed from Kingston, and,
having effected a landing on the 29th of May, advanced
with great gallantry along a causeway connecting the
island with the main land, dashed into a thick wood,
and, encountering the Americans, drove them from
amongst the trees. The detachment afterwards set fire
to the American storehouses near the fort, and retired.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had 2 private men killed, 7
wounded, and 1 taken prisoner by the enemy, in this
service.</p>

<p>During the same month, the light company of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> was sent from Chambly to Kingston, for
the purpose of instructing the flank companies of the
Canada militia regiments, which had been formed into
a light battalion, in light infantry drill.</p>

<p>On the 4th of June the head-quarters and one company
arrived at Kingston, from Montreal; on the 17th
seven companies advanced to Four-Mile Creek; and
on the following day two companies embarked from
Kingston, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Gordon,
to attack a strong post occupied by the Americans at
<em>Sodius</em>. The detachment made good its landing on the
20th of June, captured a great quantity of stores, and
burnt the public buildings; and re-embarking on the
same day, sailed to Four-Mile Creek; having sustained
a loss of 3 private men killed, and 1 serjeant and 3 private
men wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>While the battalion lay at <em>Four-Mile Creek</em>, frequent
skirmishes occurred between the British and Americans;
and on the 12th of August the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had several
private men wounded.</p>

<p>From Four-Mile Creek the battalion proceeded to
St. David's, and went into cantonments at that place
until the 1st of September, when it marched to <em>Cross-roads</em>,
and was there partially engaged with a body of
Americans, but experienced little loss. The battalion
encamped a short time at Cross-roads; and on the 8th
of October some sharp fighting took place, in which the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had 5 private men wounded, and 1
taken prisoner. On the 11th the battalion went into
quarters at Burlington.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the severity of a Canadian winter,
military operations were continued; and on the 17th
of December the grenadier and one battalion companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> marched from Burlington, under
the command of Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, towards Niagara;
and on the 19th the grenadiers, commanded by
Captain Bailey, assisted at the storm and capture of
<em>Fort Niagara</em> without sustaining any loss; and the
battalion company advanced to dislodge the enemy from
the heights of Lewiston. Colonel Murray, in his report
of this transaction to Lieut.-General Drummond, observes&mdash;"I
have to express my admiration of the valour
of the grenadier company of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> under Captain
Bailey, whose zeal and gallantry were very conspicuous;"
and in a general order published at
the time, Lieut.-General Drummond stated&mdash;"The
troops employed on this occasion were the grenadier
company of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, 100th regiment, and
flank companies of the 44th. Their instructions were,
not to fire, but to carry the place at the point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
bayonet. These orders were punctually obeyed&mdash;a
circumstance that not only proves their intrepidity,
but reflects great credit on their discipline.</p>

<p>"Lieut.-General Drummond will perform a most
gratifying duty in bringing under the notice of his
Royal Highness the Prince Regent, through his Excellency
the Commander of the Forces, the admirable
execution of this brilliant achievement on the part of
every individual concerned.</p>

<p>"The Lieut.-General has received from Major-General
Riall a very favourable report of the zeal and
alacrity of the detachment of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> under
Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, and the 41st battalion companies
under the command of Major Friend, who advanced
under the Major-General's command to dislodge the
enemy from the heights of Lewiston. The Lieut.-General
has only to regret that the enemy's rapid
retreat from Lewiston heights did not afford to Major-General
Riall an opportunity of leading them to victory."</p>

<p>After this success five companies of the battalion,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, crossed
the Niagara river, and were employed, on the 29th of
December, in storming the enemy's batteries at <em>Black
Rock</em> and <em>Buffalo</em>, and in burning and laying waste the
enemy's frontier between these places and Fort Niagara;
in which service 2 corporals and 13 private men were
killed, and 3 serjeants and 27 rank and file wounded,
and 6 rank and file were missing. The conduct of the
troops on this service was described in general orders as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The conduct and bravery of the officers and soldiers
of the advance-corps of the right division having been
crowned with the most complete success by the capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Fort Niagara, with all the enemy's guns and stores,
and the destruction of four armed vessels, and of the
cover along the whole of their frontier from that fort
to Buffalo Creek&mdash;a measure dictated not only by
every consideration of military policy, but authorised
by every motive of just retaliation&mdash;it only remains
for Lieut.-General Drummond to thank the troops for
their exertions, and to express his admiration of the
valuable qualities which they have displayed in the
course of that short but severe service, in which they
have cheerfully borne the absence of almost every comfort,
and the rigours of a climate for which they were
far from being prepared. The immediate reward of
their gallant conduct the Lieut.-General trusts will be
felt in the repose which they have so well earned for
themselves, by depriving the enemy of all the means of
present annoyance; the more remote recompense of
their exertions will be found in the approbation of their
king and country."</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>While the 1st battalion was actively employed in
Canada, the 2nd battalion marched to Bangalore; and
in April, 1813, the right wing, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
M'Kellar, took the field, and joined the force in
the southern Mahratta country, under the orders of
Lieut.-Colonel Dowse, and remained in the field twelve
months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the 3rd battalion, advancing from the frontiers
of Portugal into Spain, was actively employed in
operations. The French army, disconcerted by the
superior tactics of the British commander, retreated, and
took up a position in front of Vittoria. The allied
army followed the retreating enemy in full career, traversing
rocks and mountains, passing rivers, and overcoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
difficulties heretofore deemed insurmountable, still hovering
round the retiring enemy, and attacking his
columns when an opportunity offered. On one of these
occasions the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were engaged (18th June)
near <em>Osma</em>, and had 3 rank and file killed, 9 wounded,
and 4 missing.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June the army advanced in three
columns to attack the enemy in his position in front of
<em>Vittoria</em>. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Campbell, being in the left column under Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch,
advanced against the enemy's right flank. This portion
of the army carried the heights commanding the village
of Abechuco, and then advanced against the village of
Gamarra Major, which was carried in gallant style, the
enemy being dislodged at the point of the bayonet with
great slaughter, and the loss of three guns. Lieut.-Colonel
Campbell of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> was severely
wounded, and the command of the battalion devolved on
Major Peter Fraser. Towards the close of the action
the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, with the remainder of the division,
crossed the river Zadora, turned the enemy's right, and
cut off his retreat by the Bayonne road. The other
divisions were also successful at their several points
of attack; the French army was completely routed,
with the loss of its cannon, ammunition, baggage, and
military chest; and it fled a mere wreck to the frontiers
of France. The gallant conduct of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
in this memorable action was rewarded with the Royal
permission to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>" on their
colours. The battalion lost Captain Hay and Lieutenant
Glover, who died of their wounds; 11 rank
and file killed; Lieut.-Colonel Campbell, Lieutenants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Armstrong, Rea, M'Killigan, and Cross, Ensign Green,
Volunteer Dobbs, 4 serjeants, and 92 rank and file,
wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> marched towards
the coast, and were engaged in the siege of the strong
fortress of <em>St. Sebastian</em>. A breach having been made
on the left flank, Major-General Hay was directed to
storm the fortress with his brigade, of which the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> formed a part.</p>

<p>The battalion had passed the night of the 24th of
July in the trenches. At day-break on the following
morning it led the attack under the orders of Major
Peter Fraser, and, though exposed to a most destructive
shower of grape and musketry, which thinned the ranks,
it advanced in the teeth of this storm of fire, in the most
cool and determined manner. Major Peter Fraser,
while gallantly encouraging his brave followers by his
example, was killed; and Captain Mullen, being next in
seniority, assumed the command of the battalion, which
duty he performed with much credit. Though the
cannon of the fortress thundered in front, the French
soldiers poured down their volleys of musketry, and
hand-grenades, shells, and large stones, flew in showers
through the darkened air; yet onward went the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, and assailed the breach with a degree of valour
and intrepidity which rivalled the gallant exploits of
their predecessors under the great Gustavus Adolphus.
But the defences round the breach had not been destroyed,
and success was found to be impossible; the
storming party was consequently ordered to retire.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>battalion lost, on this occasion, Major Fraser, Captain
Cameron, Lieutenants Anderson, Clark, Massey, and
Adjutant Cluff, 6 serjeants, and 75 rank and file, killed;
Captains Arguimbeau, Logan, Stewart, Macdonald, and
Buckley, Lieutenants O'Neil, Eyre, and Reynolds,
Volunteer Miller, 7 serjeants, and 230 rank and file,
wounded; Lieutenant Reynolds died of his wounds, and
Lieutenant Eyre was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The siege was afterwards prosecuted with vigour, and
on the 31st of August the fortress was again attacked by
storm. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Barns, were directed to make their attack on the
left of the second breach, and were supported by the
38th regiment. The assault was made with great gallantry;
some of the traversers of the semi-bastion were
carried by the leading companies, but were retaken by
the enemy. Nothing could exceed the bravery and
steadiness of the troops employed at this point; and the
enemy, observing the whole division in motion, sprung a
mine on the top of the curtain; but the explosion was
premature, and only a few of the leading men of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> suffered from it. Yet undismayed by the
bursting mine, and fierce opposition of the enemy, the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> pressed forward upon their adversaries,
and carried the coverlain; the troops crowded into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>town in every direction, and in the course of an hour
were masters of the place, excepting the citadel.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th of September batteries mounting fifty-four
pieces of ordnance opened a tremendous fire upon the
citadel. In less than three hours the enemy hoisted a
flag of truce, and, after some discussion, surrendered.
As a testimony of the royal approbation of the signal
valour evinced by the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> during this siege,
and of the value attached to their services, they were
permitted to bear the words "<span class="smcap">St. Sebastian</span>" on
their colours. Their loss in the successful storm of the
town was, Ensign Boyd, 3 serjeants, 1 drummer, and
48 rank and file, killed; Lieutenants Armstrong,
Holebrooke, Macdonnell, Clark, and Suckling, 7
serjeants, and 133 rank and file, wounded. Captain
James Stewart, who was performing the duty of aide-de-camp
to Major-General Hay, was killed from the castle
while reconnoitring the works on the 4th of September.
Captain Robert Macdonald was promoted to the rank of
Major in the army, for his distinguished services at the
storm of St. Sebastian.</p>

<p>After the capture of this fortress the troops advanced
to the frontiers; and on the 7th of October the light
company of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded by Lieutenant
J. N. Ingram, crossed the <em>Bidassoa</em>, followed by
the remainder of the battalion and that portion of the
army which had reduced St. Sebastian; the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> being the first British corps of the allied army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
which entered France. Thus, after driving the legions
of Napoleon out of Portugal and Spain, the seat of war
was transferred to the enemy's country; and the interior
of France became the scene for the display of
British prowess. After crossing the Bidassoa the troops
drove the enemy to the heights of Irun, a distance of
about three miles.</p>

<p>On the 10th of November the enemy's formidable line
of works on the river <em>Nivelle</em> were attacked, and the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, with the other regiments of the 5th
division, drove the enemy from a field redoubt, and
pursued them under the guns of Bayonne. The battalion
lost, on this occasion, 1 rank and file, killed, and
4 serjeants and 15 rank and file wounded. Further
operations were retarded by snow and rain; but
in the early part of December the army passed the river
<em>Nive</em>, and drove the French into their entrenched camp
in front of Bayonne; from whence they issued on the
three following days, and attacked the allies, but were
repulsed. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were warmly engaged on
these occasions, and their gallantry was rewarded with
the royal permission to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Nive</span>" on their
colours. Their loss was 3 rank and file killed, and
1 serjeant and 3 rank and file wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th
Batt.</div>

<p>In the meantime important events had transpired on
the continent of Europe. The invasion of Russia by
Napoleon, the burning of Moscow, the disastrous retreat
of the French army from the north, and the separation
of Prussia, Austria, and other states, from the
interest of Napoleon, were followed by a treaty of alliance
and subsidy between Great Britain and Sweden, in
which it was stipulated that a Swedish army commanded
by the Crown Prince should join the allies; and on the
2nd of August, 1813, the 4th battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Scots</span> embarked under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Muller for Stralsund, in Swedish Pomerania, forming
part of an expedition sent thither under the orders of
Major-General Gibbs. Thus a battalion of the regiment
proceeded to the same part of the world to which
a body of daring Scots, who formed the nucleus of this
distinguished corps, proceeded exactly 200 years before,
to engage in the service of the Swedish monarch. The
battalion remained at Stralsund until the middle of
December, when it advanced to support the army of the
Crown Prince of Sweden on the Elbe, and halted on the
24th of December at Lubeck.</p>

<p>Thus at the conclusion of the year 1813 the regiment
had four battalions on foreign service in three different
quarters of the globe; namely&mdash;</p>

<p>The services of the 1st battalion were limited, during
the early part of 1814, to the usual duties of a corps
stationed on an enemy's frontier. On the night of the
3rd of March, Captain Stewart received information of
the appearance of a strong body of Americans in <em>Longwood</em>,
in advance of Delaware town; and he directed the
light companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, and 89th regiment,
to march at day-break, to support the advance posts.
At five o'clock on the evening of the 4th the Americans
were discovered, in very superior force, posted on a commanding
eminence, protected with breastworks formed of
logs of wood. The companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> and
89th instantly attacked the enemy in front, "in the most
gallant manner," while a company of rangers, and a detachment
of Canadian militia, made a flank movement to
the right, and a small band of Indians made a similar
movement to the left, with a view of gaining the rear of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the position. "After repeated efforts to dislodge the enemy
in an arduous and spirited contest of an hour and a half's
duration, which terminated with the daylight, the troops
were reluctantly withdrawn, having suffered severely,
principally in officers."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had
Captain David Johnstone, 1 serjeant, and 9 private men
killed; Lieutenant Angus Macdonald, 2 serjeants, and
37 private men, wounded; and a bugler taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The battalion assembled at Fort George on the 1st
of June; and on the 3rd of July two flank and five
battalion companies marched from that place towards
<em>Chippewa</em>. In the meantime a body of Americans had
landed at Black Rock, and had driven in the garrison
of Fort Erie. On the 4th the enemy advanced in force
by the river, and the light company of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
was engaged in a skirmish with the American riflemen.
On the 5th of July a severe engagement with very superior
numbers of the enemy took place.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The attack
was not attended with success. Major-General Riall,
speaking of the conduct of the troops in general orders,
observed&mdash;"Although their efforts were not crowned
with the success they deserved, yet he has the greatest
satisfaction in saying it was impossible for men to have
done more, or to have sustained with greater courage
the heavy and destructive fire with which the enemy,
from his great superiority in numbers, was enabled
to oppose them." The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had Captain
E. P. Bailey, 5 serjeants, and 71 rank and file killed;
Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, Lieutenants W. Campbell, A.

rank and file, wounded; Captains E. M. Bird and John
Wilson severely wounded and taken prisoners; 5 serjeants
and 72 rank and file missing.</p>

<p>Fort Erie afterwards surrendered to the superior
numbers of the enemy; the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> returned to
Fort George; and on the 13th of July seven companies
took up a position at Fifteen-mile Creek.</p>

<p>The three companies left at Fort George quitted that
place a few days afterwards, and, having crossed the
Niagara river on the 25th of July, marched to <em>Lewiston</em>
to attack a body of the enemy; but the Americans fled,
and the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> captured a quantity of stores and
other articles. The three companies afterwards re-passed
the river at Queenstown; and, advancing to the <em>Falls of
Niagara</em>, formed in the position of <em>Lundy's Lane</em>, under
the orders of Lieut.-General Drummond. In the mean
time the other seven companies were on the march from
Fifteen-mile Creek towards the Falls.</p>

<p>The three companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had scarcely
taken their post in the centre of the position of Lundy's
Lane, when about 5000 Americans advanced, and attacked
the British troops with great fury; and a most
sanguinary contest ensued. During the heat of the conflict
the seven companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> arrived
from Fifteen-mile Creek, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Gordon, and took post on the right of the line.
The enemy attempted to force the centre for the purpose
of gaining the crest of the position, but were repulsed
with loss, and the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> distinguished themselves
in driving back the assailants. About nine in the
evening there was an intermission of firing; but the
Americans renewed the attack soon afterwards with
fresh troops, and a fierce conflict of musketry and
artillery followed in the dark. The Americans charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
up the hill; the British gunners were bayoneted while
in the act of loading, and the guns were in the possession
of the enemy for a few moments; but the troops in the
centre, where the three companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
were fighting, soon drove back the Americans, and retook
the guns. The storm of battle still raged along the
heights; the muzzles of the British and American artillery
were within a few yards of each other, and the fight
was kept up with a sanguinary obstinacy seldom witnessed.
In limbering up the guns, at one period an
American six-pounder was put by mistake on a British
limber, and a British six-pounder on an American limber.
At one moment the Americans had the advantage; at
the next the shout of victory rose from the British ranks;
and about midnight the enemy retreated.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> The troops
were thanked for their distinguished bravery in general
orders on the following day; and "the admirable steadiness
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, under Lieut.-Colonel Gordon,
at several very critical points and movements,
claimed the Lieut.-General's particular notice." The
three companies in the centre of the line particularly distinguished
themselves, and were twice mentioned in the
Lieut.-General's public despatch in terms of the highest
commendation. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> lost on this occasion
Lieutenant William Hemphill, 3 serjeants, 1 drummer,
and 48 rank and file, killed and missing; Captain Brereton,
Lieutenants Haswell and Fraser, 4 serjeants, and
93 rank and file, wounded; Lieutenants Clyne, Lamont,
and Fraser taken prisoners. The conduct of the battalion
on this occasion, with the distinguished bravery
evinced by the grenadier company in the storm of Fort
Niagara on the 19th of December, 1813, obtained the Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>permission to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Niagara</span>" on the colours
of the regiment.</p>

<p>An attack on <em>Fort Erie</em> having been resolved upon,
the 1st battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> appeared before
this place on the 4th of August, and formed part of the
besieging force. During the progress of the siege several
slight skirmishes occurred; and on the 10th of August
the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had Lieutenant Gregor M'Gregor and
3 private men killed and 9 private men wounded.</p>

<p>The batteries having produced an impression on the
place, a general assault was made on the fort and adjoining
works on the 15th of August before day-break;
and two companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> formed part of
the force selected to storm the fort and entrenchments
leading from it to the lake. This portion of the storming
party made its attack with signal gallantry, and after
a desperate resistance succeeded in effecting a lodgment
in the fort through the embrasures and demi-bastion,
and turned the guns against the enemy, when a sudden
explosion of some gunpowder placed under the platform
occurred, and almost all the men who had entered the
place were either killed or dreadfully mangled. This
occasioned the troops to retreat; the enemy opened a
heavy fire of musketry, and the storming party retired.
The eight companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> which had not
taken part in the storming of the fort were immediately
thrown out to cover the retreat&mdash;"a service which that
valuable corps executed with great steadiness."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The
loss of the battalion in this unfortunate affair was&mdash;Captain
Torrens and 32 rank and file killed, 2 serjeants and
37 rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The troops continued before the fort, and on the 9th
of September 2 private soldiers of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></span>
were killed, and Lieutenant P. Grant wounded by a
shell. On the 17th the enemy made a sortie, and an
engagement took place, which lasted nearly five hours.
"On the right the enemy's advance was checked by the
1st battalion <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, supported by the 89th
regiment, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Gordon
of the Royals; and in the centre he was driven
back by the Glengarry light infantry, under Lieut.-Colonel
Battersby, and directed by Lieut.-Colonel
Pearson, inspecting field officer."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> On this occasion
the battalion lost 2 serjeants and 22 rank and file killed
and missing; Lieut.-Colonel Gordon, Lieutenant Rutledge,
and 30 rank and file, wounded. Lieutenant Rutledge
died on the same day, and Lieut.-Colonel Gordon
on the 25th.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>On the 17th of October the battalion marched to
Chippewa, and engaged the enemy at <em>Cook's Mills</em>,
drove the Americans from their post, without sustaining
any loss. Shortly afterwards the battalion proceeded to
Fort Niagara, where it was stationed during the remainder
of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>In April, 1814, the left wing of the 2nd battalion in
the East Indies marched to Bellary; at the same time
the right wing, forming part of the force in the southern
Mahratta country, quitted the field, and joined the left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>wing at Bellary in May. Soon afterwards the battalion
proceeded to Hyderabad, where it remained until the
beginning of November, when it received orders to
proceed to Ellichpoor, to join the field force under the
command of Brigadier-General Doveton, and was subsequently
employed against a barbarous people called
the <em>Pindarees</em>, who infested the British territory in
India at this period, and committed dreadful ravages
wherever they appeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>The 3rd battalion was employed in the spring of 1814
in the blockade of the strong fortress of <em>Bayonne</em>, in
France; while a great part of the allied British, Spanish,
and Portuguese army, which had passed the Pyrenees
mountains, advanced up the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th
Batt.</div>

<p>In the meantime the Dutch had made an energetic
struggle to free themselves from the power of Napoleon,
and a strong party had declared in favour of the Prince
of Orange. A British force was sent to Holland under
the orders of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards
Lord Lynedoch, and the 4th battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> was ordered from the north of Germany to join
the troops in Holland. The battalion accordingly commenced
its march from Lubeck on the 17th January,
1814, and encountered many difficulties, from the inclemency
of the weather. While traversing the forest
of <em>Shrieverdinghen</em>, 120 men were lost in a snow storm;
much extreme suffering occurred during the journey;
and on the 2nd of March the men went into cantonments
at Rozendalh. After halting six days the battalion was
ordered to join the force destined to make an attempt
on the strong fortress of <em>Bergen-op-Zoom</em>; and was
selected to form part of the 4th column of attack; at the
same time its flank companies were detached to join
another column. The attack was made about ten o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
on the night of the 8th of March. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
succeeded in crossing the Zoom, and forced an entrance
by the water-port. Having gained possession of the
ramparts round the water-port gate, the battalion was
exposed to a heavy fire of grape and musketry from two
howitzers, and a strong detachment of French marines,
stationed near the arsenal: two companies were detached
to keep the enemy in check, and were relieved
every two hours by two other companies of the battalion.
These companies were actively engaged in this service
from eleven o'clock until daylight; when the enemy
made a furious attack in strong columns, which bore
down all before them. The two detached companies of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were attacked by a host of combatants,
and driven in. A heavy fire of grape was opened upon
the battalion from the guns of the arsenal; and it was
forced to retire by the water-port gate, when a detached
battery opened upon it. Being thus placed between two
fires, with a high palisade on one side, and the Zoom
filled with the tide on the other, the battalion was unfortunately
obliged to surrender. The colours were first
sunk in the river Zoom by Lieutenant and Adjutant
Galbraith: the battalion then surrendered, on condition
that the officers and men should not serve against the
French until exchanged. The failure of the coup-de-main
on Bergen-op-Zoom occasioned an immense sacrifice
of gallant men. Of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, Captains
M'Nicol, Edward Wetherall, and Purvis, Lieutenant
Mills, 1 serjeant, and 36 rank and file, were killed; Lieutenants
Robertson, Stoyte, Midgley, and Stewart, 7
serjeants, 1 drummer, and 63 rank and file, wounded.</p>

<p>On the following day the battalion marched out of
Bergen-op-Zoom, and on the 8th of April it embarked
for England: on the 21st it arrived at Hilsea barracks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
where it was supplied with clothing and equipments, and
on the 6th of May it embarked on board the Diomede
and Leopard (two sixty-fours, armed en-flute), and
sailed for Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the success of the arms of the allied sovereigns
in various parts of Europe had been followed by
the abdication of Bonaparte, and the restoration of the
Bourbon dynasty to the throne of France. This event
occurred in April, 1814, at which time the 3rd battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> was employed in the blockade of
<em>Bayonne</em>. The French commandant in this fortress, not
believing the statement of Bonaparte's abdication to be
true, made a sortie with the garrison on the morning of
the 14th of April, and gained a temporary advantage;
but was afterwards repulsed. Major-General Hay,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, was killed at the
first onset; the battalion also had 5 rank and file killed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Captain Buckley, Lieutenant Macdonnell, 1 serjeant, 1
drummer, and 32 rank and file, wounded; also a few
private men missing.</p>

<p>This was the last action of the war; and the British
troops, after vanquishing the legions of Bonaparte in
various parts of the globe, stood triumphant in the
interior of France, and saw the fall of that gigantic
power which had shaken the throne of every sovereign
on the continent of Europe, and, aiming at universal
empire, had sought to rule the world with Asiatic despotism.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> remained encamped near
Bayonne until August, when they marched back to
Spain, and were the last British corps which quitted the
French territory after the termination of this glorious
war. The battalion, having embarked at Passages for
Ireland, landed at the Cove of Cork on the 13th of
September, 1814.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince Regent was pleased
to confer upon the 3rd battalion the honour of bearing
the word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>" upon its colours, as a mark of
his royal approbation of its meritorious conduct in Portugal
and Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th
Batt.</div>

<p>The right wing of the 4th battalion, which sailed for
Canada in May, arrived at Quebec on the 26th of June,
and on the 1st of July sailed up the St. Lawrence to
Three Rivers; but the left wing, in the Leopard, was
wrecked on Anticosti, a barren island in the mouth of
the river St. Lawrence, and lost all its arms and baggage.
The right wing afterwards returned to Quebec,
and, the left having joined it, the battalion formed part
of that garrison until May of the following year.</p>

<p>In January, 1815, the first battalion quitted Fort
Niagara, and proceeded to Queenstown. From this place
it proceeded to Fort George, Kingston, Prescott, Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>real,
and Three Rivers, which latter place it reached on
the 25th of May, when it embarked for Quebec; and
on its arrival off Cape Diamond, peace having been concluded
with the United States, it was removed on board
of transports. At the same time the 4th battalion was
withdrawn from garrison at Quebec, and, having embarked
on board the fleet, both battalions sailed for
England, and arrived at Portsmouth on the 17th and
18th of July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd
Batt.</div>

<p>In the meantime Napoleon Bonaparte, with that perfidy
which had ever marked his conduct, had quitted the
island of Elba, and, attended by 600 men, made his appearance
on the shores of France. The French troops
joined the standard of the invader, the royal family fled,
and Bonaparte reascended the throne with a rapidity
which exceeded the wildest flights of poetry or romance.
The peace of Europe was thus broken. The allied
sovereigns resolved to wage war against the usurper;
and in April, 1815, the 3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
was suddenly ordered from its quarters at Fermoy to
the Cove of Cork, to embark for the Netherlands, where
a British force was assembling to engage in the approaching
contest, under Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington&mdash;a
leader under whose eye this portion of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment</span> had already acquired numerous laurels in the
Peninsular War.</p>

<p>The battalion landed at Ostend in the early part of
May, and proceeded to Ghent, and from thence to Brussels,
where it was stationed several weeks. It formed
part of the 9th brigade, commanded by Major-General
Sir Denis Pack, and was placed in the 5th division,
under the command of Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Picton.</p>

<p>During the night between the 15th and 16th of June,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
while the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were reposing in comfortable
quarters at Brussels, the men were suddenly aroused by
the bugles sounding and drums beating to arms. Instantly
quitting their beds, the soldiers prepared for
action, and, seizing their muskets, issued in bands from
every part of the city; and in a few hours the British
regiments were passing through the dark forest of
Soignes in the direction of Charleroi, a sharp conflict
having already commenced between the corps in advance
and the enemy. After a march of about twenty-two
miles, the 5th division arrived at the scene of conflict
soon after mid-day on the 16th of June, and, diverging
from the high road, confronted the enemy on the undulating
grounds near the farm-house of <em>Quatre Bras</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, advancing from their post in the
centre of the 5th division, by a movement to their left
through a field of corn which reached to the shoulders
of the tallest men, encountered a column of French
infantry, and by a determined charge drove it from its
ground. The enemy's musketeers rallied under the
protection of their formidable cavalry, and opened a
galling fire, which was returned by the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
with steadiness and precision. The enemy, having the
advantage of a rising ground, poured down volley after
volley of grape and musketry with dreadful execution.
The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> stood their ground with unflinching
firmness; and, after fighting for some time in line, the
battalion formed square, to resist the French cavalry,
which was advancing in great force. The valour and
intrinsic merit of the corps were now tested; but in vain
the foaming squadrons of cuirassiers came rushing forward&mdash;in
vain the daring swordsmen sought to penetrate
the square; neither the superiority of their numbers, nor
the fury of their charge, availed against the <span class="smcap">Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Scots</span>; the battalion stood firm, and resisted every
attack of the enemy with an unshaken fortitude, which
reflected honour on the corps.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> After repulsing the
formidable onsets of the enemy's steel-clad horsemen, the
battalion deployed; again the French cuirassiers and
lancers advanced, and the battalion once more formed
square. The daring squadrons rushed forward in full
career; the battalion sent forward a shower of balls,
which emptied a hundred saddles, and the remaining
horsemen wheeled round, and galloped away.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Thus
the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were triumphant, and they were soon
afterwards moved to sustain the 28th regiment, which
had suffered severely: another furious onset was made
by the French cavalry, when the two corps formed one
square, and repulsed their assailants with firmness. The
French, dismayed by the sanguinary resistance of their
adversaries, and being attacked in turn, were already
giving way. Sir Thomas Picton placed himself at the
head of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> and 28th regiment, and leading
them to the charge, the enemy was driven from his
position with loss.</p>

<p>The battalion passed the following night on the field.
The Prussians had been attacked on the 16th of June at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>Ligny, and forced to retreat to Wavre; a corresponding
movement was made by the Duke of Wellington, to
keep up the communication with the Prussians, and the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, retreated on the 17th of June, with the
remainder of the army, to the elevated grounds in front
of the village of <em>Waterloo</em>, where the troops passed a
stormy night in the open fields, drenched with rain.</p>

<p>On the memorable 18th of June the battalion formed
part of the reserve under the gallant Sir Thomas Picton.
At the commencement of the battle, when the enemy
sent forward a cloud of skirmishers, and developed his
massy columns of attack, the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded
by Major Colin Campbell, were instantly engaged with
the legions of Napoleon. "I have great pleasure," observes
an officer, who was an eye-witness, "in detailing
the conduct of the gallant 3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, and though I have been present with the
battalion at the battles of Busaco, Fuentes d'Onor,
Salamanca, Vittoria, both stormings of St. Sebastian,
the passage of the Bidassoa, &amp;c., &amp;c., in all which they
bore a most conspicuous part, and suffered severely, I
can assure you they never evinced more steadiness, or
more determined bravery, than at the late battle.</p>

<p>"About nine o'clock on the morning of the 18th
June, the battalion was attacked by the enemy, and,
with very little interruption, the entire day it formed
a line of skirmishers in front of the brigade.</p>

<p>"I have often seen the battalion engaged, but, I must
confess, on this trying day, it far excelled anything I
had ever witnessed; and indeed, so pleased was the
late General Picton with its gallantry and good conduct,
that he several times expressed it himself to the
battalion in the most flattering terms."</p>

<p>Thus, while the thunder of 400 cannon, the roll of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
musketry, the occasional explosion of caissons, the
hissing of balls and grape-shot, the clashing of arms, and the
impetuous shouts of the combatants, produced an awful
scene of carnage and confusion, the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were
seen amidst the storm of battle, boldly confronting the
torrent of superior numbers, and fighting with a constancy
and valour which the enemy could not overcome.
Corps after corps advanced; but amidst the dense smoke
which often prevented the combatants from distinguishing
each other, the British colours waved triumphant, and
the shout of victory rose above the din of combat.
Paralyzed by the astonishing resistance of the British
arms, the attacks of the enemy relaxed; the Prussians
arrived on the left, to co-operate, the Anglo-Belgian army
formed line, and with one impetuous charge overthrew
the French host, and drove it in wild confusion from the
field of battle, with the loss of its cannon and equipages.
Those warlike and numerous legions, which a few hours
before meditated only rapine and conquest, were mingled
in utter confusion along the road, and over the fields,
while the allied squadrons poured on their shattered
flanks and rear, and sabred the panic-struck fugitives
without mercy or intermission. Thus ended a battle,
the greatest of past or present times, the importance and
character of which are above the reach of sophistry or
mis-statement; a battle, which may in itself be considered
an era, and the story of it, serving as a monument to
commemorate the national glory, will survive when the
brightest historical epochs on record shall be lost amid
the obscurity and confusion of ages. In the important
conflicts on the 16th and 18th of June, the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
had Captain Buckley, Lieutenants Armstrong, O'Niel,
and Young, Ensigns Kennedy, Robertson, and Anderson,
1 serjeant-major, 4 serjeants, and 29 rank and file,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
killed; Major Campbell; Brevet-Majors Arguimbeau,
M'Donald, Massey, and Dudgeon; Lieutenants Rea,
Ingram, Simms, Clark, Mann, G. Stewart, Alstone,
Dobbs, Morrison, Miller, Lane, Black, Scott, and Adjutant
Cameron; Ensigns Cooper, Stephens, and
M'Kay; Quarter-Master Griffith; Volunteer Blacklin;
20 serjeants, and 275 rank and file, wounded.</p>

<p>The battalion advanced with the main army into
France, and encamped on the 6th of July at Clichy, on
the banks of the Seine, two miles from Paris, where it
remained nearly four months.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

4th

<p>In the meantime the 1st and 4th battalions had
arrived at Portsmouth from Canada (as before stated),
and the 4th having been completed to 1000 effective
rank and file, by the transfer of men from the 1st, sailed
for the Netherlands, to join the allied army under the
Duke of Wellington; at the same time the remainder of
the 1st battalion sailed for Scotland, and was stationed
in Edinburgh Castle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th

<p>The 4th battalion having landed at Ostend, marched
up the country to Paris, and pitched its tents at Clichy,
where the 3rd battalion was also encamped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd

<p>After the flight of Bonaparte, and the restoration of
Louis XVIII. to the throne of France, rewards were
conferred on the officers who had distinguished themselves
during the war;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and the honour of bearing the

3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>; every officer and
man present at the battles on the 16th and 18th of June,
1815, also received a silver medal, to be worn on the left
breast, attached by a crimson and blue riband, and the
soldiers had the privilege of reckoning two years' service
towards additional pay and pension on discharge.</p>

<p>The 3rd battalion quitted the camp at Clichy on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>29th of October to go into cantonments for the winter:

<p>During the winter the 4th battalion was ordered to
return to England,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> where it arrived in the early part of
1816. From the period of its formation the 4th battalion
was considered as a dep&ocirc;t to the other battalions of the
regiment, until it embarked for Germany, in 1813. All
recruits enlisted for the regiment, volunteers from the
militia, and sick and wounded men sent home from
foreign service with any prospect of being again fit for
military duty, joined the 4th battalion; and the recruits
were completely drilled before they were sent to join the
other battalions.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Peace having been restored, the battalion
was disbanded at Dover on the 24th of March,
1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>In February of the same year the 1st battalion
marched from Edinburgh Castle to Port Patrick, where it
embarked for Ireland, and remained in that country
nearly ten years.</p>

<p>The 3rd battalion, forming part of the army of
occupation in France, marched from Gillecourt in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>January, 1816, and went into garrison at Valenciennes.
It quitted this place in March, 1817, and proceeded to
Calais, where it embarked for England, and landed at
Dover on the 24th of the same month. It shortly afterwards
marched to Canterbury barracks, where it was
disbanded on the 24th of April, 1817.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st

<p>The regiment was thus reduced to its former establishment
of <span class="smcap">TWO BATTALIONS</span>; and the men of the 3rd
battalion having been transferred to the 1st and 2nd
battalions, His Royal Highness the Prince Regent was
pleased to grant permission to the 1st and 2nd battalions
to bear the words "<span class="smcap">Busaco</span>," "<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>," "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">St. Sebastian</span>," "<span class="smcap">Nive</span>," "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>," and
"<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>," on their colours, in commemoration of
the distinguished services of the 3rd battalion of the
regiment, as before narrated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>In the meantime the 2nd battalion had continued
actively employed in the East Indies against the <em>Pindarees</em>,
and these barbarous hordes being composed
entirely of horsemen, the services of the corps were of an
arduous and trying nature; traversing extensive districts
by forced marches, passing rivers and thickets, and
attempting to surprise these bands of plunderers, were
duties calculated to exhaust the physical powers of Europeans
when performed under an Indian sun.</p>

<p>While the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were engaged in these
services, several of the native princes prepared to wage
war against the British. Their designs were partly
discovered and disconcerted by the Marquis of Hastings.
Hostilities, however, followed, and the battalion was
called upon to engage in the contest. The eight battalion
companies formed part of the second division
under the command of Brigadier-General Doveton; and
the flank companies were destined to form part of the
1st division of the army of the Deccan, under Lieut.-General
Sir Thomas Hislop, Baronet.</p>

<p>The battalion was stationed at Jaulnah; from whence
the flank companies marched on the 11th of October,
1817, under the command of Captain Hulme, with two
regiments of native cavalry, and four guns, to join the
head-quarters of the 1st division, and arrived at Hurda
on the 22nd. The battalion companies quitted Jaulnah
on the 15th of October, under the command of Brevet
Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, (Lieut.-Colonels N. M'Leod,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and
Neil M'Kellar having the command of brigades,) and
arrived, with the remainder of the 2nd division, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>train of elephants, camels, and horses, at Meiker, on the
23rd. From this place the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were detached,
with the battering train, down the Berar Ghats, with the
design of taking part in the reduction of Asseerghur, an
important fortress, belonging to a native sovereign named
Scindia; but the order was suddenly countermanded,
and the division was directed to proceed to <em>Nagpore</em>, the
capital of the Mahratta territories, an attack having been
made on the British force at that place. The division
proceeded for this station without delay; and the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, following by forced marches, rejoined the head-quarters
on the 7th of November, at Oomrouttee.
From this place Brigadier-General Doveton pushed
forward with the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, and part of his division,
and having encountered excessive fatigue, by constant
marching, arrived on the 12th in the vicinity of Nagpore,
where he was joined by the remainder of the division on
the following day. In the meantime the British troops
at this place had taken post on two strong eminences
near the residency, on which attacks had been made by
the Rajah's forces, and one of the eminences had been
carried by a great superiority of numbers; but the other,
though attacked, had been maintained.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Brigadier-General Doveton's division,
the Rajah was inclined to come to terms, and he
at length agreed to surrender his guns and disperse his
troops; but the treachery he had already evinced induced
the Brigadier-General to dispose his troops in
order of battle when he advanced to take possession of
the guns. The troops were accordingly formed in the
following order:&mdash;Two regiments of native cavalry and
six horse artillery six-pounders on the height; on its left
Lieut.-Colonel M'Leod's brigade, composed of a wing
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, four regiments of native infantry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
and the flank companies of another native regiment;
Lieut.-Colonel M'Kellar's brigade, consisting of a division
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, a regiment of native infantry,
and a detachment of horse artillery with four guns; on
its left was Lieut.-Colonel Scot's brigade, of a division
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, a regiment of native infantry, and
a detachment of foot artillery with sappers and miners,
and two guns; a reserve of native infantry supported
the line, and the principal battery of the artillery was
posted in the rear of Lieut.-Colonel M'Leod's brigade.
On the left of the position was an enclosed garden;
beyond it the Nagah Nuddee; a small river ran from
thence past the enemy's right; and three parallel
ravines, terminating in the bed of the river, crossed the
space between the infantry and the enemy; but in front
of the cavalry, and on their right, the country was open.
The enemy's position was masked by irregularities of
the ground and clusters of houses and huts, and a thick
plantation of trees, with ravines, and a large reservoir.
On this ground the Rajah had formed an army of 21,000
men, of which 14,000 were horse, with seventy-five guns.
Such was the ground on which the battle of <em>Nagpore</em>
was fought. Beyond the river lay the city, from the
walls of which the movements of both armies could be
perceived.</p>

<p>The Rajah had agreed, after much procrastination,
to surrender his guns at noon on the 16th of December;
and the British force was put in motion to receive them.
The first battery was taken possession of without opposition;
but on the troops entering the plantation, the
enemy treacherously opened a sharp fire of musketry
on them. The action then commenced. The columns
deployed. The brigades under Lieut.-Colonels M'Leod
and M'Kellar carried the enemy's right battery with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
great gallantry, and afterwards drove the right wing
from its ground. The other batteries were also carried,
and the supporting troops routed, and the enemy was
driven from all his positions, and pursued a distance of
five miles. The enemy's camp equipage, 40 elephants,
and 75 guns were captured; and the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
added to their former honours that of standing triumphant
in the interior of India, over an immense superiority
of numbers of the enemy. The battalion lost on this
occasion 9 rank and file killed, and 26 wounded.</p>

<p>After this success the siege of the city of <em>Nagpore</em>
was commenced. The troops which defended this place,
consisting of about 5000 Arabs and Hindoostanees, insisted
upon extraordinary terms; and these not being
granted, they resolved on a desperate defence. On the
23rd of December a breach was made at the Jumma
Durwazza gate, and an assault on the place was resolved
on. One company of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, under the command
of Lieutenant Bell, with five of native infantry,
and a proportion of sappers and miners, were allotted
for this service; and two other companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, under the command of Captain H. C. Cowell,
were destined to attack the city at another gate; and the
remaining five companies were kept for the protection of
the batteries.</p>

<p>At half-past eight o'clock on the morning of the 24th
of December the signal was given, when the storming
party, rushing from the trenches, gained the breach, but
were instantly assailed by a heavy fire of matchlocks from
the adjoining buildings; at the same time the British
troops were unable to injure their numerous antagonists,
either by the fire of musketry or coming to close quarters.
The Arabs, thus sheltered behind walls, each marked
with fatal aim, and with impunity, his destined victim;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and their fire under these circumstances is destructive
at distances beyond that where European musketry is
considered effective. Lieutenant Bell, of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, a most promising officer, who had served with
the 3rd battalion during a great part of the war in Spain,
was killed while gallantly leading his men to the attack;
and the breach being found untenable, the troops were
ordered to withdraw. The other storming parties succeeded
in gaining the desired points; yet their positions
were also untenable, and they were ordered to retire.</p>

<p>On the following day the Arabs renewed their offer
to surrender; and their terms being acceded to, they
marched out of the city on the 1st of January, 1818,
and were allowed to go where they pleased, with the
exception of proceeding to Asseerghur. The loss of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> in the attack on <em>Nagpore</em> was 1 lieutenant
(Bell) and 10 rank and file killed, with 2 serjeants and
49 rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Doveton, in his despatch to the
Commander-in-Chief in India, stated&mdash;"During the
operation in the field of the 2nd division of the army
of the Deccan under my command, the conduct of the
2nd battalion of His Majesty's <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, under the
immediate command of Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, has been
invariably such as to entitle that valuable corps to my
highest approbation and applause; and more particularly
in the action with the enemy's army at this place
on the 16th ultimo, their gallantry, steadiness, and good
conduct were most exemplary."</p>

<p>Thus, whether Europe, Asia, Africa, or America be
the scene of conflict, the conduct of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
appears to have been uniformly the same; and the gallantry
displayed by the 2nd battalion on this occasion
was rewarded by the royal permission, dated the 29th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of March, 1823, to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Nagpore</span>" on its
colours.</p>

<p>In the meantime the two flank companies, commanded
by Captain Hulme, had been engaged in several
movements with the 1st division of the army of the Deccan,
and passed the Nerbuddah in flat-bottomed boats on
the 30th of November. On the 8th of December the
division arrived at Peepleea, and after four marches encamped
in the vicinity of Oojain, a short distance from
<em>Maheidpoor</em>, where the army of Mulhar Rao Holkur,
one of the coalesced Mahratta powers against the British
interests in India, was assembled. After various fruitless
negociations, the division advanced against the
enemy on the morning of the 22nd of December; and
as the troops were crossing the ford of the Seeprah river
they were exposed to a powerful and concentrated cannonade.
About half a mile beyond the river stood the
army of Holkur; and after passing the stream Brigadier-General
Sir John Malcolm advanced with two brigades
of infantry to attack the enemy's left and a ruined village
situated on an eminence near the centre. The companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> formed part of this force;
and in the action which followed they evinced their native
valour in a signal way. The enemy's left was brought
forward in anticipation of the attack, and a destructive
fire of grape shot was opened on the British; yet, encouraged
by the example of Sir John Malcolm and Lieut.-Colonel
M'Gregor Murray,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> rushed
forward in the face of this tremendous fire; the enemy's
infantry were driven from their position, and the village
and batteries were carried at the point of the bayonet;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>the enemy's artillerymen were resolute, and stood their
ground until they were bayoneted. While the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> were victorious at their point of attack, the enemy's
right was overpowered; his centre gave way on the appearance
of a brigade ascending from the river; and his
troops, occupying a position where his camp stood, also
fled on the advance of a British force to attack them.
Thus the army of Mulhar Rao Holkur was routed; and
in a general order, dated the 23rd of December, the
Commander-in-Chief of the army of the Deccan observed&mdash;"The
undaunted heroism displayed by the
flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> in storming and
carrying, at the point of the bayonet, the enemy's guns
on the right of Lieut.-Colonel Scot's brigade, was
worthy of the high name and reputation of that regiment.
Lieutenant M'Leod fell gloriously in the charge,
and the conduct of Captain Hulme, Captain M'Gregor,
and of every officer and man belonging to it entitles
them to his Excellency's most favourable report and
warmest commendation."</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> on this occasion was
Lieutenant Donald M'Leod, 1 serjeant, and 7 rank and
file, killed; Lieutenants John M'Gregor and Charles
Campbell, 4 serjeants, 1 drummer, and 27 rank and
file, wounded. In commemoration of the valour evinced
by these two companies the battalion obtained the
royal permission to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Maheidpoor</span>" on
its colours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>Arrangements having been made for the pursuit of
Holkur, the troops advanced on the 28th of December,
and on the 30th formed a junction with part of the
Bombay army, under the command of Major-General
Sir William Keir Grant, at Taul. Advancing from
thence on the following day, the troops encamped in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
beginning of January, 1818, at Mundesoor, and soon
afterwards, Holkur's government having been brought
to submission, the presence of the 1st division of the
army of the Deccan being no longer necessary in this
part of India, it marched southward. On the 22nd of
January it crossed the Seeprah river, on the 24th it
reached Oojain, where it halted until the 28th. On the
30th it was at Indoor; on the 13th of February it recrossed
the Nerbuddah, and proceeding in the direction
of the Taptee, encamped on the left bank of that river
on the 27th, in the vicinity of <em>Talnere</em>, a town and fortress
belonging to Holkur, formerly the capital of the
sultans of the Adil Shahy dynasty, in the fifteenth century,
which, it had been agreed, should be delivered up
to the British government, but which, unexpectedly,
opened a fire upon the advanced part of the division.
A summons was sent to the Killedar, who commanded
the garrison, warning him of the consequences of resistance;
and, no answer being returned, a battery was
brought to bear on the fort, which silenced the enemy's
fire in a few hours, but not before several casualties had
occurred from the well-directed fire of matchlocks from
the walls. On a further examination of the fort, one of
the outer gates was discovered to be in a ruinous state;
and the flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> and of the
Madras European regiment, were placed under the
orders of Major Gordon, of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, for the
attack of the gate. The garrison offered to capitulate;
and an unconditional surrender was demanded without
delay; but, the evening being advanced, it was suspected
the enemy would attempt to escape during the
approaching darkness, and the storming party advanced
up to the gate. A passage for single files between the
walls and the frame of the outer gate was discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
and no opposition being offered, the storming party and
pioneers entered: they subsequently passed the second
gate, and at the third were met by the Killedar and
some natives. Lieut.-Colonel Conway, the Adjutant
General to the army, with Lieut.-Colonel M'Gregor
Murray, had entered with the storming party, and they
passed through the third and fourth gates; but at the
fifth and last gate they were stopped, though the wicket
was opened. A hurried conversation about terms of
surrender now took place; and Colonel Murray, concluding
that there was an urgent necessity for establishing
such a footing as would secure eventual success
should the enemy hold out, entered by the wicket with
Major Gordon and three grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span>, but refrained from drawing his sword, to show he
had no intention of breaking off the parley. Five persons
only had passed the wicket when the enemy fell
upon them, and in a moment laid them all dead, excepting
Colonel Murray, who fell towards the wicket
covered with wounds. The enemy attempted to close
the wicket, but were prevented by a grenadier, private
Sweeny, of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, who thrust his musket
into the aperture: Lieut.-Colonel M'Intosh and Captain
M'Craith forced the wicket open, and it was held in this
state while the captain was with one hand dragging
Colonel Murray through, and with the other warding off
blows with his sword. A fire was then poured in through
the wicket, which cleared the gateway sufficiently for the
grenadiers of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, under Captain M'Gregor,
who formed the head of the storming party, to enter,
and the fort was carried by assault, but at the expense of
the captain's life. The garrison was put to the sword, and
the Killedar was hanged on the same evening. The
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had Major Gordon, Captain P. M'Gre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>gor,
and 3 private men killed; Lieutenant John M'Gregor
(brother to the captain),<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and 3 rank and file,
wounded. The conduct of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> on this
occasion was spoken of, in general orders, in terms of
commendation; and the intrepidity and courage of
Major Gordon and Captain M'Gregor were especially
noticed.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the 2nd division of the army of the
Deccan, with which the eight battalion companies of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were serving, had been withdrawn from
Nagpore, and proceeded (22nd January) towards Ellichpoor.
In the early part of February, detachments
from the division captured the two strong hill-forts of
<em>Gawelghur</em> and <em>Narnullah</em>. The division was afterwards
encamped at Ootran; in March it proceeded to
Copergaum, and on the 17th of that month encamped on
the left bank of that noble river the Godavery, near Fooltaumba;
at the same time the 1st division was encamped
on the opposite bank of the river. Here the 2nd division
resumed its former designation of the Hyderabad division.
Two flank and three battalion companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> were directed to proceed to Hyderabad; and the
remaining five companies continued in the field with the
force under Brigadier-General Doveton. These companies
were commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, and
on his appointment to the command of a brigade, by
Captain Joseph Wetherall,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> the next officer in seniority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The division was engaged in operations against Peishwah
Bajee Rao (one of the Mahratta confederacy), who,
with an army of cavalry said to amount to 20,000 men,
studiously avoided a conflict with the British field force,
and sought to accomplish his object by sudden marches
and surprises. Information having been received of an
intended attack of this chief on the cantonments of Jaulnah,
the Hyderabad division, with which were three companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded by Captain
Wetherall (the other two companies remaining at Fooltaumba),
proceeded seventy-two miles in two forced
marches, and before the remaining thirty miles were
accomplished, the Peishwah had proceeded in another
direction. After a short halt, the division continued the
pursuit of the flying enemy, encountering many difficulties
while traversing parts of the country which had
never before witnessed the presence of a British army,
and using the most indefatigable exertions, it frequently
occurring that the troops occupied the ground which
Bajee Rao had left on the preceding day. After a circuitous
route, having performed forty-one marches in forty
days, at the hottest period of the year, during which time
the division had only two halts, the troops returned for
supplies to Jaulnah, where they encamped on the 11th
of May. In this difficult service the European soldiers
had not evinced any want of physical power; they had
performed their marches cheerfully, and their only com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>plaint
was not being able to overtake the flying enemy.
After a halt of two days, the division again resumed the
chase of its flying foe, and continued the pursuit until
the Peishwah surrendered himself to the British government,
when it returned to Jaulnah.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
left at Fooltaumba, under the command of Lieutenant
Bland, had marched with a body of troops, under Lieut.-Colonel
M'Dowall, of the East India Company's service,
into the Candeish country, and had captured the
fort of <em>Unkye</em>, situated on the summit of the Candeish
Ghats, also the forts of <em>Rajdeir</em> and <em>Inderye</em>, in which service
the two companies had a few private men wounded.
They were next engaged in the reduction of the strong
hill-fort of <em>Trimbuck</em>, situated near the source of the river
Godavery, which surrendered on the 25th of April; their
loss on this occasion was 1 serjeant, 1 drummer, and
8 private men, wounded. The conduct of the <span class="smcap">Royal
Scots</span> in this service was spoken of in terms of commendation
in detachment orders. The capture of Trimbuck
was followed by the surrender of seventeen other forts.</p>

<p>After this service the detachment proceeded to the
strong fort of <em>Malleygaum</em>, situated on the river Moassum,
and defended by a party of the Arabs, who surrendered
to Brigadier-General Doveton at Nagpore.
This place was defended by two lines of works, with
very high walls, the inner one of superior masonry and
surrounded by a ditch 25 feet deep and 16 feet wide. On
the 18th of May a sortie of the garrison was repulsed;
and on the 19th two batteries opened their fire. A
breach having been effected, an attempt was made to
carry the fort by storm: 2 officers and 50 rank and file
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, commanded by Lieutenant Bland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
formed part of the principal storming party against the
breach, and Lieutenant Orrock and 25 rank and file
part of a column destined to make an attack on another
point; but success was found impracticable, and the
storming party was withdrawn. Another point of attack
was afterwards selected, and new batteries raised. Two
of the enemy's magazines having been blown up, the garrison
surrendered, and the British flag was hoisted on
the walls of <em>Malleygaum</em>, on the morning of the 13th of
June. The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> lost in this siege 5 rank and
file killed; Ensign Thomas, 1 serjeant, 1 drummer, and
11 rank and file, wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>The whole of the hill-forts in the Candeish being reduced,
the two companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> proceeded
to Jaulnah, and joined the other three companies of the
battalion, with the Hyderabad division at that place.
Here the troops expected to take up their monsoon
quarters; but, when all who were obliged to live under
canvass were busily engaged in making arrangements to
mitigate the severity of the approaching rains, the division
was ordered to proceed with all possible expedition
to Nagpore. Quitting Jaulnah on the 7th of August,
the troops commenced the march, and the dreaded rains
immediately set in; the roads became almost impassable;
the baggage was unable to keep up with the
troops, and the tents were consequently in the rear, so
that the men were frequently exposed for twenty-four
hours to incessant rain; no shelter could be procured in
the villages, and every comfort was wanting. Exposed
to these calamities, the troops arrived at Ellichpoor on
the 3rd of September in such a state as to be totally
unfit to proceed any further. Here they halted until the
21st of December, when they were again put in motion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and halted at Walkeira on the 30th, where the five
companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> were, in consequence of
their long service in the field, relieved by a division of
His Majesty's 30th regiment from Hyderabad. The
five companies then returned to Jaulnah, expecting to
continue their march to the Deccan, but were ordered to
proceed to Boorhaunpoor in charge of a battering train
which lay at Jaulnah. On the 1st of March, 1819, they
rejoined the Hyderabad division, encamped near the city
of Boorhaunpoor, and marched to engage in the siege of
the celebrated fortress of <em>Asseerghur</em>, which, on account
of its strength, was termed "the Gibraltar of the East."
This fortress is situated on a detached hill, not commanded
by any other in its neighbourhood. It consists
of an upper and lower fort; the upper one, of an
irregular form, about 1100 yards from east to west, and
about 600 from north to south; it crowns the top of the
hill, which is about 750 feet in height; and all round it,
with the exception of one place which is strongly fortified,
there is a perpendicular precipice from 80 to 120 feet,
surmounted with a low wall full of loop-holes. Below
this are two lines of works, the outer one forming the
lower fort, which rises directly above the pettah, and the
entrance to which is protected by strong gateways and
flanking works; and immense labour and great skill had
been employed in rendering this naturally strong post
almost impregnable. Such was the formidable fortress
against which the five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>
were about to be employed.</p>

<p>The Hyderabad division was encamped at Neembolah,
about seven miles from this celebrated fortress,
belonging to his Highness Doulat Rao Scindia, and,
negotiations having failed, about twelve o'clock on the
night of the 17th of March, five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Scots</span>,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> commanded by Captain J. Wetherall, with the
flank companies of the 30th, 67th, and Madras European
regiments, five companies of native infantry, and a
detachment of sappers and miners, the whole commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, and a
reserve, commanded by Major Dalrymple, of the 30th,
assembled at the camp for the attack of the pettah of
Asseer; another party was also directed to co-operate in
this service from Sir J. Malcolm's division.</p>

<p>Between one and two o'clock the column commenced
its march; advancing up the bed of a deep nullah, or
small river, nearly dry at the time, the assaulting party
arrived unobserved within 500 yards of the pettah, then
rushed upon the gate with the greatest ardour and steadiness,
the five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> leading
the way. The enemy was surprised, and, after discharging
a few rounds of grape, retired without making
further opposition. The head of the attacking column
forced the gate, and, proceeding up the main street,
encountered an advanced piquet of the enemy, which
retired to the lower fort, firing occasionally at the head
of the column. Major Charles M'Leod, of the East
India Company's service, Deputy Quartermaster-General,
acted as guide on the occasion, and by his direction
the leading files of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> pursued the enemy
close under the walls of the fortress, from whence an
incessant fire of artillery and matchlocks was kept up,
and a few ill-directed rockets were also discharged. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
leading sections of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, which had pursued
the enemy up the hill, were joined by one or two files of
the 30th and 67th regiments, the whole amounting to
about 25 or 30 men; and as soon as the enemy saw the
small force before which they had so precipitately fled,
they immediately rallied, and came shouting down the
hill with augmented numbers to attack this small party,
but were repulsed by a spirited charge with the bayonet,
which, with a few rounds of musketry, obliged them to
retreat within the works, some of which were within 50
or 60 yards of this handful of men, leaving their chief,
who was shot by a soldier of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, and
several men, on the ground. Major M'Leod, being
wounded, proceeded to the rear; and the enemy having
established a cross fire from the walls of the lower fort
and from two cavaliers, Captain Wetherall ordered the
advanced party to retire a short distance to a post established
by Lieut.-Colonel Fraser, where there was some
cover for the men. The loss of the leading sections
in this affair was 1 private soldier killed; Major
M'Leod, Lieutenant Bland, and 11 rank and file,
wounded. The remainder of the column did not sustain
any loss, the men being protected from the enemy's
fire by the houses in which they had established themselves.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The assaulting party maintained its post until night,
when it was relieved by fresh troops, and the five companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> returned to their tents,
which had been left standing at Neembolah; but
Lieut.-Colonel Fraser remained in command of the
troops at the pettah. At day-break on the 19th a
heavy gun battery opened against the fort. At dusk
in the evening a party of the enemy issued from the
lower fort, crept unperceived down a deep ravine to the
rear of the pettah, and gained the main street, where
they encountered the British troops, and were repulsed
and forced to abandon their enterprise. Lieut.-Colonel
Fraser, of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, while in the act of gallantly
encouraging the soldiers, and directing them to
withhold their fire and give the enemy the bayonet,
was shot in the head and fell dead on the spot: his body
was afterwards conveyed to the camp at Neembolah
and interred with military honours.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>On the 21st of March the five companies of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> took their turn of duty in the pettah,
where they arrived a little before day-break. As soon
as it was light a heavy gun battery opened on the forts
with great effect, but it had only fired about a dozen
rounds when, from some accident which could not be
explained, the magazine in the rear of it, containing
130 barrels of gunpowder, exploded, killing a conductor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
of ordnance, a native officer, and 34 non-commissioned
officers and rank and file, and wounding another native
officer and 65 non-commissioned officers and rank and
file. Such was the violence of the explosion that about
six inches of the top of a bayonet was blown nearly six
hundred yards from the battery. From this period
until the 29th new batteries of heavy guns and mortars
were erected, and, a breach having been effected in the
wall of the lower fort, the enemy abandoned it and
retired to the upper one: the lower fort was taken
possession of on the morning of the 30th by part of
Sir John Malcolm's division.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span>, with the remainder of the Hyderabad
division, had in the meantime removed from their
ground at Neembolah and occupied a position three
miles north-east of the fortress. During the progress of
constructing the new batteries on elevated and commanding
situations, the dragging of ordnance into many
of them was performed by the European soldiers, who
literally worked like horses; and during the whole of
the time they were annoyed by a constant fire of matchlocks
from the walls of the upper fort, but which was too
distant to prevent the execution of this herculean labour,
which was performed with that ardour and cheerfulness
so characteristic of British soldiers, when necessity
demands any extraordinary exertions from them.</p>

<p>On the 31st of March part of the Bengal army, consisting
of 2,200 native troops, with 22 pieces of heavy
ordnance, commanded by Brigadier-General Watson,
joined the besieging force; and these guns were soon
placed in battery, and opened on the fort. The storm
of war now raged round <em>Asseerghur</em> with awful fury;
the shot and shells from the numerous British batteries
flew in showers, a dozen shells sometimes exploding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
within the area of the upper fort at the same moment,
and a breach was soon effected in the outer retaining
wall at the only assailable part of the fort; at the same
time two batteries of 18 and 24-pounders were directed
against the inner wall. This unremitting fire was continued
until the 6th of April, when the garrison, apprehending
the consequences of having to sustain an attack
on the works by storm, forced the Killedar to sue for
terms, namely, "liberty to preserve their arms and to
depart with their personal property." These conditions
being refused, hostilities recommenced; the Killedar,
however, accepted the terms offered on the 8th, and
agreed on his part to surrender the fort on the morning
of the 9th, and the firing ceased; but, as he said he
could not answer for the garrison, the control of which
he had lost, preparations were made for renewing operations
in case of refusal. The garrison, however, submitted;
a British guard took possession of the gates
at the appointed hour; and a union flag was sent, with
an escort of 100 Europeans and the like number of
native infantry, to the upper fort, and hoisted under a
royal salute from all the batteries. The garrison,
amounting to 1200 men, marched out at noon and
grounded their arms. Their loss was inconsiderable,
from having such good cover from the fire of the British
batteries, being only 43 killed, and 95 wounded; and
this was chiefly occasioned by the bursting of shells.
The loss of the besieging army was 11 European and 4
native officers, and 95 European and 213 native soldiers
killed and wounded, including the loss at the explosion
of the magazine on the 21st of March. Of this number
the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> had only 7 rank and file killed and
wounded in addition to the loss on the 18th of March.
The force employed against Asseerghur amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
about 20,000 men; the ordnance of all calibre to 61 guns
and 40 mortars and howitzers: the enemy had 119 guns
and mortars mounted on the works, and some of the guns
were of immense calibre&mdash;one a 384-pounder.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In a general order, dated Madras, 28th April, 1819,
the conduct of the five companies of the regiment was
spoken of in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The conduct of the detachment of His Majesty's
<span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> under the command of Captain Wetherall,
and of His Majesty's 30th Foot, under Major
Dalrymple, during the siege of Asseer, has been most
exemplary, and such as to reflect the most distinguished
credit on their several commanding officers,
as well as on the whole of the officers and men
composing those detachments."</p>

<p>After the capture of this fortress the services of the
five companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal Scots</span> being no longer
required with the Hyderabad division, on the morning
of the 11th of April they commenced their march for the
Deccan, for the purpose of joining the head-quarters and
the other five companies, which had quitted Hyderabad
in December, 1818, and had proceeded to Wallajahbad,
forty-seven miles from Madras: and on the 24th of July
the several companies of the battalion were united at
that station.</p>

<p>The battalion remained at Wallajahbad until the 21st
of December, when it marched for Trichinopoly, where
it arrived on the 11th of January, 1820.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<div class="sidenote">Regiment.</div>

<p>On the 23rd of January, 1820, the much-lamented
event, the decease of His Royal Highness the Duke
of Kent, occurred, which occasioned great grief to the
corps, His Royal Highness having always evinced a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
constancy of attention to, and interest in, the welfare
and credit of the regiment, which endeared his name
in the grateful remembrance of the officers and men.</p>

<p>The Colonelcy of the regiment was conferred, on the
29th of January, on Lieut.-General George Marquis of
Huntly, only surviving son of Alexander, fourth Duke
of Gordon, from the 42nd Highlanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In August of the following year His Majesty King
George IV. was pleased to approve of the regiment
resuming its designation of the "<span class="smcap">First, or the Royal,
Regiment of Foot</span>," instead of the "<span class="smcap">First, or Royal
Scots, Regiment of Foot</span>."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<div class="sidenote">2nd Batt.</div>

<p>The 2nd battalion remained stationary at Trichinopoly
until June, 1824, when it marched to Madras,
where it halted until September. In the meantime
hostilities had commenced between the British and the
Burmese empire; and in September the battalion
embarked from Madras and sailed for Calcutta, where
it arrived on the 10th of October. Towards the end of
the year it marched to Barrackpore for the purpose of
suppressing a mutiny amongst the Company's native
troops at that place; and after the performance of this
painful duty it returned to Calcutta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>In the middle of January, 1825, it received orders
to proceed to Rangoon, a city and principal port of the
Burmese empire, situated on the north bank of the river
Irawaddy, thirty miles from the sea, to reinforce the
troops under Brigadier-General Sir Archibald Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
employed against the Burmese army. It accordingly
embarked from Calcutta under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Armstrong,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> on the 15th of that month;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>and on its arrival at Rangoon, the enemy having been
driven from his position in its vicinity, the flank companies
advanced with the army upon Prome, a city
situated about 150 miles up the river Irawaddy, while
the battalion companies formed part of the reserve.</p>

<p>The advance was commenced on the 12th of February;
owing to the nature of the country and the want
of sufficient means for transporting the necessary military
stores, part of the force proceeded by land, and the
remainder in boats up the river Irawaddy. The flank
companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by Captain
Tenison, formed the advance-guard of the land column,
which was commanded by Brigadier-General Sir A.
Campbell. Proceeding along a narrow and difficult
path, tending obliquely toward the Irawaddy river, the
column marched through the provinces of Lyng and
Sarrawah; and on its arrival at Mophi, between two
and three thousand Burmese, commanded by Maha
Silwah, quitted an old pegaun fort, where they had
evinced some determination to resist, and dispersed
into a close jungle in the rear. From Mophi the column
continued its progress, uninterrupted by the enemy,
and forded the river Lyng at Thaboon on the 1st of
March. The Carian inhabitants of the country through
which the army marched viewed the expulsion of the
Burmese with much satisfaction, and assisted the troops
in making roads and in procuring supplies of rice and
buffaloes. On the 2nd of March the division arrived
at Sarrawah, on the Irawaddy, where its junction with
the water column had been intended. This column
had destroyed several of the enemy's stockades, and
had continued its course up the river until it arrived
within sight of <em>Donabew</em>, where a series of formidable
stockades extending nearly a mile along the banks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the Irawaddy, and protected by about 15,000 Burmese,
presented a formidable opposition. Information was
received of a gallant but unsuccessful attack having been
made on this post by the water column; and Sir Archibald
Campbell resolved to retrace his steps with the
land column, and concentrate his force for the reduction
of this formidable position. He accordingly crossed the
Irawaddy at Sarrawah by means of canoes and rafts,
which, owing to the insufficiency of the craft employed,
was not effected in less than five days. After halting
two days at Henzada, the column pursued its march
along the right bank of the river, and arrived before
Donabew on the 25th of March: on the 27th a communication
was opened with the water column, under
Brigadier-General Cotton, of the 47th regiment, and
both columns co-operated in the reduction of the place.
Batteries were constructed without delay, and during
the progress of these operations the enemy made several
spirited <em>sorties</em>: on one occasion <em>seventeen elephants</em>
were sent out, each carrying a complement of men,
supported by a body of infantry; but the result proved
the inutility of employing such means against British
troops. In the beginning of April the batteries opened
their fire, and shortly afterwards, the Burmese commander,
Maha Bandoola, having been killed by the
bursting of a shell, the enemy deserted the place and
retreated through the jungles in the direction of Lamina.
The intrenchments were immediately taken possession
of, and considerable stores of grain and ammunition,
with a number of guns of various descriptions, fell into
the hands of the British. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> at this place
had only one private man wounded.</p>

<p>After the capture of Donabew the troops resumed
their march; and having crossed the Irawaddy on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
7th of April, at Sarrawah, were joined at that place
by the reserve from Rangoon, consisting of eight companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Armstrong, a regiment of native infantry, and
a supply of elephants; the whole under the orders of
Brigadier-General M'Creagh. Thus reinforced the
army pushed forward; the Burmese retreated; and the
British troops arrived before Prome without the necessity
of firing a shot: this city, though strongly fortified,
was deserted, and in part burnt. Shortly afterwards
the wet season set in, and during the heavy rains the
army remained inactive; but no opportunity was
omitted of entering upon pacific negociations with the
Burmese government.</p>

<p>Information having been received of the approach
of the enemy with a considerable force towards the
British position, a reconnoissance was made up the river
in a steam-boat by fifty men of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment,
under Brigadier-General Cotton; and on the 15th of
August the enemy was discovered at Meeaday, on the
left bank of the river, about forty miles from Prome,
with a force of between 16,000 and 20,000 men, who
appeared all armed with muskets: they had also a
small force on the right bank of the river. The Burmese
opened a battery of 16 guns upon the reconnoitring
party, but the width of the river being upwards of three-quarters
of a mile, their shot fell short. On the 16th
the steam-boat returned to Prome.</p>

<p>In the early part of September pacific overtures were
made by the enemy, and an armistice was afterwards
concluded, when the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were selected to preserve
the line of demarcation between the two armies. Terms
of peace were also proposed, namely,&mdash;"a large portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of territory was to be ceded by the Burmese, and two
crores of rupees paid as an indemnification for the expenses
of the war." These conditions produced the utmost
indignation at the court of Ava, and a determination
to resist their invaders and prosecute the war with
vigour. Hostilities recommenced on the 16th of November;
and three bodies of British native infantry
were soon afterwards repulsed in an attack upon the
enemy's advanced position;&mdash;the Burmese being in greater
force than was anticipated, and the troops sent against
them insufficient to contend against so considerable a
superiority of numbers.</p>

<p>The result of this attack inspired the Burmese generals
with a high but false idea of their own power; and
they advanced from their position with their whole force,
amounting to between 50,000 and 60,000 men. Brigadier-General
Campbell had only about 6000 men to
oppose to this formidable host, which threatened to
surround him; but though so very inferior in numbers to
the enemy, he calmly awaited their approach, and determined
to avail himself of any favourable opportunity
of attacking them. In the meantime, in order to prevent
the enemy's attempts to intercept his communication
with Rangoon, and cut off his supplies, which had to be
brought a distance of 150 miles up the river Irawaddy,
the British commander established 100 men of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, and an equal number of native infantry,
under the command of Captain Deane of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span>, at <em>Pagahm-Mew</em>, a few miles below Prome,
on the Irawaddy, supported by a division of the flotilla
on the river under Lieutenant Kellett, of the Royal
Navy. This detachment was frequently attacked by
superior numbers, and the meritorious conduct of both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
officers and men is detailed in the following copies of
letters from Captain Deane to the Adjutant-General
of the Forces serving in Ava:&mdash;</p>

<p>20th November.&mdash;"I have the honour to report, for
the information of the Commander of the Forces,
a brush which took place between the party under
my command and the enemy this morning.</p>

<p>"In the early part of the morning the fog was so
thick as to preclude our seeing anything in our front,
and on its clearing up I discovered, by means of a
reconnoitring party, that the enemy were in considerable
force on the edge of the jungle in front of my
left, and shortly afterwards I discovered them marching
in three columns across my front, for the attack of
my right, left, and centre;&mdash;their main object being
evidently to gain the right of the village. I, consequently,
detached a party to turn their left, and had,
in a few minutes, the satisfaction to observe that
column retiring in confusion, and with considerable
loss. I then moved forward with the remainder of
my party to attack their centre, which also retired in
confusion after a very few rounds: during this time
their right was engaged with a strong piquet which I
had placed to dispute the passage of a bridge on the
left of the village&mdash;this the piquet effectually did. In
both the defence of my centre and left, I was much indebted
to the prompt assistance afforded me by Lieutenant
Kellett, R.N.</p>

<p>"The enemy's force consisted of two gilt chattahs,
and about 800 men armed with muskets and spears,
with two or three jinjals; their loss I conceive to
have been about 25 or 30 men killed. We had not, I
am happy to say, a single man wounded. The enemy,
however, from the great extent of the village, succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
in setting fire to it at both ends, but very little damage
was done, as we extinguished it almost immediately.
The Rajah and all his attendants deserted the place
the moment the firing commenced; he has, however,
just returned, and appears much more composed, and
highly delighted with the result."</p>

<p>November 25th.&mdash;"I have the honour to report, for
the information of the Commander of the Forces,
another affair which we have had with the Burmese
this morning.</p>

<p>"A little before day-break we had embarked 20 men
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and 30 sepoys of the 26th Madras
native infantry, in light row-boats, intended to co-operate
with Lieut.-Colonel Godwin, on the opposite
side of the river. They were just in the act of shoving
off from the shore when the enemy, to the amount of
5000 or 6000, made a rush at our works, howling
most horribly, and, at the same time, setting fire to
the village, which they had entered at all points. We
had fortunately got an 18-pounder into battery late
yesterday evening, which, added to two 12-pounders
which we had before, did great execution. Lieutenant
Kellett, R.N., was at this moment shoving off with
the row-boats, but instantly returned to our assistance
with all his men, and kindly undertook the superintendence
of our guns, the well-directed fire of which
so mainly contributed to our success. The enemy,
after nearly two hours' sharp firing, retired in admirable
order, carrying off great numbers of dead and
wounded; so much so, that we have not been able to
find more than 10 or 12 dead bodies. I am happy to
add, that, with the exception of one man slightly
grazed in the elbow by a musket-shot, we have not a
man either killed or wounded. The Rajah's house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
was very early in flames, and is burnt to the ground;
indeed, I may say the village is completely destroyed.
The guns in the boats were of the greatest assistance
in scouring the village with grape. We got possession
of one jingal and three muskets. The enemy
appeared to have several mounted men, but I cannot
say what they were."</p>

<p>November 26th.&mdash;"The enemy appeared in great
force this morning at day-break all along our front,
and had a good deal of skirmishing with the piquets;
but we could not succeed in drawing them within
musket-shot of our works. They are all armed with
muskets, and have a great many jinjals, and two or
more guns, with which they annoyed us very considerably,
having taken up a position in the woody
part of the village, from whence they opened a musket
fire on the boats. From this I determined to dislodge
them, and sent out a strong party for that purpose;
these came close upon them, and drove them out,
with, I have every reason to believe, considerable loss.
They are, however, by no means discomfited, and are,
I understand, determined to entrench themselves
round us, and make regular approaches, as their
orders are peremptory to carry the place. In confirmation
of this a number of their entrenching tools
were left behind by the killed and wounded. Our
only casualty this morning, I am happy to say, is
one Lascar severely, but not dangerously, wounded: the
shot first grazed the jaw-bone, entered the shoulder,
and came out under the arm-pit. From one of the
prisoners taken this morning, whom I have, by this
opportunity, forwarded to Major Jackson, I learn
there are absolutely 5500 men now here, and that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
further force is hourly expected from Puttow-down,
where, he says, the Setahwoon now is."</p>

<p>Thus 200 British troops resisted the attack of between
5000 and 6000 of the enemy; which occasioned Sir
Archibald Campbell to observe in his despatch, "the
meritorious conduct of both officers and men, as detailed
in the enclosed copies of letters from Captain
Deane, will, I am certain, obtain for them the approbation
of the Right Honourable the Governor-General
in council."</p>

<p>While this detachment was maintaining its post
against such very superior numbers of the enemy,
Brigadier-General Sir A. Campbell had resolved to
make an attack upon every accessible part of the Burmese
line, to the east of the Irawaddy, extending from a
commanding ridge of hills to two villages about eleven
miles north-east of Prome. The enemy's army was
divided into three corps, all protected by stockades, and
occupying positions of difficult approach; but each separated
from the other by local obstructions, so that they
could be attacked separately.</p>

<p>Leaving four native regiments for the defence of
Prome, the General marched early on the morning
of the 1st of December against the enemy's left flank at
<em>Simbike</em>; during this movement the battalion companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were on board the flotilla under
Sir James Brisbane, diverting the attention of the enemy
from this movement by an attack upon another part of
their position, and otherwise co-operating with the land
force. On arriving at the Nawine river the army was
divided into two columns. The right, under Brigadier-General
Cotton, in which were the flank companies of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, proceeding along the left bank of the river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
came in front of the enemy's works, consisting of a series
of stockades, covered on both flanks by thick jungle,
and by the river in the rear, and defended by a considerable
force, in which were 8000 Shans, a people of
Laos, under their native chiefs, who bore a high character
for gallantry, and these people were inspired with
confidence by the presence of a female, whom they
considered a prophetess. Notwithstanding the formidable
appearance of these works, crowded with Burmese
and Shans, and bristling with spears, the flank companies
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, commanded by Captain Harvey,
with the 41st and 89th regiments, supported by the 18th
Madras native infantry, the whole commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Godwin, instantly stormed the stockades, in gallant
style, and carried them in less than ten minutes.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The Burmese fled,&mdash;the Shans, who had never encountered
British troops before, fought manfully a short time,
but were soon overpowered, and their prophetess mortally
wounded. The enemy left 300 dead, including
their veteran commander, Maha Memiow, who was 75
years of age, in the works; also their stores and ammunition,
with a considerable quantity of arms, and 100
Cassay horses. The left column, under Sir Archibald
Campbell, having crossed the Nawine, came up as
the fugitives were retreating, and completed the dispersion
of this wing of the Burmese army. The
loss of the flank companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment in
this action was&mdash;1 serjeant and 2 rank and file, killed:
Ensign Campbell, who died on the succeeding day, and
5 rank and file, wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Following up this advantage, Sir A. Campbell resolved
to attack the centre division of the Burmese army, posted
on the Napadee hills, which was not effected without
considerable difficulty and some loss, but which proved
quite successful; the Burmese were driven from their
stockades and entrenchments, and forced to seek safety
in a precipitate flight.</p>

<p>The battalion companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, having quitted
the flotilla, joined the division under Brigadier-General
Cotton,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> which crossed the <em>Irawaddy</em> in the course of
the night of the 4th of December, to attack the enemy's
right wing under Sudda Woon, posted on the left bank
of the river. On the following morning the attack was
made in conjunction with the navy and flotilla, and the
Burmese were soon driven from their extensive works
near the banks of the stream. On taking possession of
these defences it was discovered, that the enemy had a
stockaded work about half a mile in the interior, completely
manned and occupied by guns. Against this
stockade the troops instantly advanced with their native
energy and fortitude;&mdash;Brigadier-General Armstrong,
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, Colonel Brodie, and Colonel Godwin,
moved against the enemy's centre and right; at the
same time Brigadier-General Cotton advanced with the
companies of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment against the left, and
the work was instantly carried,&mdash;the enemy leaving 300
dead on the field, and dispersing in every direction.
Several prisoners were taken, and from 300 to 350 muskets,
which the Burmese had abandoned in their flight,
were broken by the soldiers. Brigadier-General Cotton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>observed in his despatch,&mdash;"I have to add my warmest
acknowledgments to Brigadier Armstrong, who commanded
the advance; to Colonel Brodie, who had
charge of the light companies; and to Colonel Godwin,
who commanded the reserve; and to every officer
and man engaged. I am happy to say this service
was performed with the trifling loss of one man killed
and four wounded." Thus in the course of four days
the immense army of Ava, which had threatened to
envelope Prome, and to swallow up the little body of
British troops which had penetrated into the interior
of the Burmese empire, was driven from its positions;
and, as the timorous herd is put to flight by the lion of
the forest, so the legions of Ava fled with precipitation
before the fierce attacks of the British, and sought for
shelter amongst their thick jungles.</p>

<p>The British force was now at liberty to advance
upon Ummerapoora, the modern capital of the Burmese
empire, situated on the shores of a romantic lake
at a short distance from the left bank of the Irawaddy.
Part of the Burmese army had been rallied and had
taken post on some strong positions near Meeaday.
Against these positions the British troops advanced in
two divisions; the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> were embarked and sailed
up the river in the flotilla, to support one of the land
divisions under Brigadier-General Cotton. During the
first stages of the march the troops proceeded along a
difficult road through thick jungle, and the men were
frequently deluged with rain, which proved injurious
to their health, and many of them suffered from attacks
of the cholera. When the troops drew near to Meeaday
the Burmese evacuated their position and took post at
<em>Melloone</em>, on the right bank of the Irawaddy, on a series
of fortified heights, and a formidable stockade, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was considered the <em>chef-d'&#339;uvre</em> of the Burmese engineers.
The British troops took post at Patanagoh, on
the left bank of the river, opposite the enemy's works.
The Burmese sent a flag of truce, and expressed a desire
to put an end to the war; they also not only permitted
the flotilla, on which the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had embarked, to pass
close under their works without interruption, but likewise
sent out two gaudy war-boats to act as pilots, and the
British naval force anchored above the town, by which
the enemy's retreat by the river was cut off. The conditions
of the treaty were afterwards discussed. The
Burmese negotiators objected to the payment of money,
and stated they were unable to raise such a sum. They
stated they might, by using great economy, pay a million
baskets of rice within a year, but they did not grow
rupees; and, if the British had any objection to the rice,
there were abundance of fine trees in the forests which
they might cut down and take away instead of the
money. Finding these and other arguments unavailing,
the treaty was concluded, and a limited time given for
its being ratified. In the meantime a cessation of hostilities
had been agreed upon until the 18th of January,
1826, and the troops remained stationary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st
Batt.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>While the 2nd battalion was thus employed in the
interior of the Burmese empire, where British troops had
never appeared before, the 1st battalion remained in
Ireland, whither it had proceeded in the early part of
the year 1816, as before stated. On the 25th December,
1825, it was separated into six <em>service</em> and four
<em>reserve</em> companies; and in January, 1826, the <em>service</em>
companies embarked at Cork for the West Indies, and
the <em>reserve</em> companies embarked, at the same time and
place, for the Isle of Wight: the former landed at Barbadoes
in the spring, and the latter, after remaining a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
short time in the south of England, embarked at Gravesend
for Scotland, and landed at Leith in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2nd
Batt.</div>

<p>Leaving the 1st battalion at Barbadoes and in Scotland,
the record resumes a statement of the military
operations in which the 2nd battalion was engaged
against the barbarian forces of Ava. The armistice
being in force, a free intercourse prevailed between the
two armies; and on the 6th of January, 1826, a boat
arrived at Patanagoh from Ava with letters from Surgeon
Sandford and Lieutenant Bennett, of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment: these officers had left Prome while the battalion
was stationed at that place in order to proceed to
Rangoon, in consequence of ill health, and fell into the
enemy's hands a little below Padoun.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>The treaty of peace not having been ratified within the
stipulated time, and the Burmese authorities appearing
to follow a system of perfidy and evasion, hostilities
recommenced on the morning of the 19th of January;
and, after the British batteries had made an impression
on the enemy's works at <em>Melloone</em>, the position was
attacked by storm and carried in gallant style. The
Burmese fled in confusion and dismay, leaving their
ordnance and military stores behind; and the terror of
the British arms filled the court of Ava with consternation:
but, still indulging a vain and delusory hope
of eventual success, new levies were made, and a new
general and a new army took the field.</p>

<p>On the 25th of January the army resumed its march
towards the enemy's capital, and on the 31st it was met
by Dr. Price, an American missionary, and Dr. Sandford,
whom the sovereign of Ava had despatched as
messengers of peace. Terms, similar to what had
already been agreed upon, were offered, but the British
commander refused to halt until they were accepted;
he, however, promised not to pass Pagahm-Mew, which
was between him and the capital, in less than twelve days.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>The Burmese resolved once more to try their fortune
in battle, and their army was formed in position to stop
the advance of their invaders. This brought on an
action, which was fought on the 9th of February, near
<em>Pagahm-Mew</em>; and on this occasion the Burmese abandoned
their system of combating behind barriers, and
encountered the British force in the open field; but after
a contest of five hours the barbarians were overthrown, and
the conquerors were left in possession of Pagahm-Mew,
with all its stores, ordnance, arms, and ammunition.</p>

<p>No opposing army now remained between the British
and the capital of the Burmese empire; the troops continued
their route through a country which presented a
wide extent of rich and well-cultivated grounds, thickly
interspersed with copsewood and villages; while temples
and pagodas adorned the banks of the river, and gave an
imposing effect to this glittering eastern scenery. Terror
and consternation prevailed at the Burmese court; and
when the army had arrived within four days' march of
the capital, it was met by the ratified treaty, which put
an end to the war. A party of officers from the army
visited the capital, and were received by the humbled
monarch with every honour.</p>

<p>Thus an eastern empire, with its myriads of inhabitants,
was subdued by the constancy and valour of a
handful of British troops, who had marched from victory
to victory, and had forced a haughty monarch to sue for
peace. The following is an extract from an order issued
by the Governor-General of India on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"While the Governor-General in Council enumerates,
with sentiments of unfeigned admiration, the achievements
of the First, or <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, the 13th, 38th, 41st,
45th, 47th, 87th, and 89th Regiments, the Honourable
Company's Madras European Regiment, and the
Bengal and Madras European Artillery, as the Euro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>pean
troops which have had the honour of establishing
the renown of the British arms in a new and distant
region, his Lordship in Council feels that higher and
more justly-merited praise cannot be bestowed on
those brave troops than that, amidst the barbarous
hosts which they have fought and conquered, they
have eminently displayed the virtues and sustained
the character of the British soldier."</p>

<p>The meritorious conduct of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> was rewarded
by King George IV. with the honour of bearing the
word "<span class="smcap">Ava</span>" on their colours.</p>

<p>The object of the war having been accomplished, the
troops commenced retiring in the early part of March;
the 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment proceeded
down the river Irawaddy in boats to Rangoon, where
it arrived on the 25th of March. After remaining at
this place a few days, the 1st division, under Lieut.-Colonel
Armstrong, embarked for Madras, where it landed
on the 18th of May. The 2nd division, under Captain
L. MacLaine, followed, and, having landed on the 19th
of June, the battalion was encamped near Madras until
the beginning of July, when it marched to Bangalore.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>Arnee the battalion proceeded to Marmalong Bridge,
about seven miles from Madras, where it was encamped
for several weeks; and while at this station the following
order was issued:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">"Fort St. George, 25th February, 1831.</p>

maintaining the honour of the British arms, and in
establishing peace with the Ava dynasty.</p>

<p>"The Right Honourable the Governor in Council
has only further to add, that the conduct of the officers
and men of His Majesty's <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>,

<p>The first division of the battalion embarked for England
on the 29th of January 1831; the remainder proceeded
on the 21st of March to Fort St. George, and the second

<p>On the 24th of September the <em>dep&ocirc;t</em> companies of this

<p>Previous to the arrival of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> in Lower
Canada, the minds of the inhabitants of that flourishing
colony were agitated by factious men, who sought
to dictate to the Government measures not deemed conducive
to the welfare of the state. During the summer,
the House of Assembly refused to proceed in its deliberations
until the demand for the total alteration of the
legislative powers was complied with; and this was
followed by the appearance of many of the colonists in
arms, and by open violations of the law. The revolt
rapidly extending, the law-officers of the Crown and the
magistrates of Montreal applied to Lieut.-General Sir
John Colborne, K.C.B. (now Lord Seaton), the commander
of the forces in Canada, for a military force to assist in
apprehending several persons charged with high treason,
who were supposed to be at the villages of St. Denis and St.
Charles; and Colonel Gore was sent with detachments
of the 24th, 32nd, and 66th regiments, and one howitzer,
with a magistrate to St. Denis; at the same time Lieut.-Colonel
Wetherall, K.H., of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, was directed to
move with Captain David's troop of Montreal cavalry,
four companies of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, a detachment of the 66th,
and two six-pounders, from Chambly, on <em>St. Charles</em>, a
village seventeen miles from the ferry at Chambly, to
assist the magistrates in executing the warrants.</p>

<p>The detachment under Lieut.-Colonel Wetherall
passed the river Richelieu by the upper ferry at Chambly;
but the severity of the weather, and the bad state of the
roads, impeded the march, and information having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
received of the increased numbers of the rebels at St.
Charles, the detachment halted at St. Hilaire until
joined by another company of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> from
Chambly. On the 26th of November the detachment
resumed its march, and on arriving within a mile of St.
Charles it was fired upon by the insurgents on the
opposite side of the river, and one man of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span>
Regiment was wounded. Several rifle shots were also
fired from a barn in front, which was burnt by the
detachment. On arriving at the vicinity of St. Charles
1500 rebels were found posted in a close stockaded work,
which was attacked; and after firing a few rounds, the
troops assaulted and carried the defences by storm,
killed a number of the rebels, took sixteen prisoners, and
burnt the buildings. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> had 1 Serjeant and 1
rank and file killed; 8 rank and file severely, and 7
slightly, wounded. Lieut.-Colonel Wetherall's horse
was shot under him during the action, and Major
Warde's horse was severely wounded, and died afterwards.
The detachment of the 66th had 1 man killed and 3
wounded.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Wetherall observed in his despatch:&mdash;"Every
officer and man behaved nobly. Major Warde
carried the right of the position in good style, and
Captain Glasgow's artillery did good execution. He
is a most zealous officer. Captain David's troop of
Montreal cavalry rendered essential service during the
charge."</p>

<p>After this success the detachment retired, on the 27th
of November, to St. Hilaire, and advanced on the
following day towards <em>Point Olivi&egrave;re</em>, to attack a body
of rebels who had taken post at that place, and constructed
an abatis, for the purpose of cutting off the
retreat of the detachment; but when the troops formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
for the attack, the rebels, after exchanging a few shots,
fled, leaving two guns mounted on carts behind them.
The detachment returned on the same day with 25
prisoners to Chambly, the men having suffered much
from heavy rains, roads knee-deep in mud, and also
from frost and snow.</p>

<p>In the meantime the detachments under Colonel Gore
had, from obstructions of a formidable nature, and from
the severe state of the weather, failed in the attempt on
St. Denis, and had retired. The conduct of Lieutenant
Lysons of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, attached to the Quarter-Master
General's department, who was employed on this
service, was spoken of in terms of commendation, and
also the exertions of Surgeon Farnden, in rendering
assistance to the wounded. After the success of the
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> at St. Charles, the rebels broke up from their
post at St. Denis.</p>

<p>The rebellion was, however, not arrested in its
progress, and the troops had much harassing duty to
perform in severe weather. On the 13th of December
Lieut.-General Sir John Colborne proceeded with all
his disposable force (including the companies of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment) towards <em>St. Eustache</em>, to put down
the revolt in the country of the Lake of the Two Mountains,
where the insurgents had driven the loyal
inhabitants from their homes, and had pillaged an
extensive tract of country. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, with the
Montreal rifles, and Captain Globinsky's company of
volunteers, formed a brigade under Lieut.-Colonel
Wetherall. The volunteers were detached to the woods
bordering on the upper road to St. Eustache, to drive in
and disperse the rebel piquets. The remainder of the
brigade, with the other disposable troops, crossed the
north branch of the Ottawa river on the ice, on the 14th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
of December, advanced upon St. Eustache, and entered
the village at several points. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and Montreal
rifles advanced up the main street, and took possession
of the most defensible houses. An officer was detached
to bring up the artillery; but he was driven back by the
fire of the rebels, who had taken post in the church. The
artillery entered the village by the rear, and opened
their fire on the church door, while some companies of
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> and rifles occupied the houses nearest to the
church. After about an hour's firing, and the church
doors remaining unforced, a party of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
assaulted the presbytery, killed some of its defenders,
and set it on fire. The smoke soon enveloped the church,
and the remainder of the battalion advanced; a
straggling fire opened upon them from the Seignior's
house, forming one face of the square in which the
church stood, and Lieut.-Colonel Wetherall directed the
grenadiers to carry it, which they did, killing several,
taking many prisoners, and setting it on fire. At the
same time part of the battalion commanded by Major
Warde entered the church by the rear, drove out and
slew the garrison, and set the church on fire. 118
prisoners were made in these assaults. The <span class="smcap">Royals</span>
had 1 man killed and 4 wounded in this service.</p>

<p>On the 16th the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> advanced with the remainder
of the disposable force to St. Benoit, where no opposition
was offered; and the rebels sent delegates to say they were
prepared to lay down their arms unconditionally. The
<span class="smcap">Royals</span> returned to Montreal, where they arrived on the
17th of December with the prisoners. The good results
of these movements were the return of the peasantry to
their usual occupations, and the disappearance of armed
parties of the rebels.</p>

<p>The foregoing account proves the antiquity of the
<span class="smcap">First, or Royal Regiment of Foot</span>, and gives a
statement of its services for a period of more than 200
years, during which it has acquired laurels under the
great <span class="smcap">Gustavus Adolphus</span>, king of Sweden, and under
the French Marshals, <span class="smcap">Turenne</span>, the Prince of <span class="smcap">Cond&eacute;</span>,
<span class="smcap">Luxembourg</span>, and <span class="smcap">De Crequi</span>: it has since formed a
part of the British army which has fought and conquered
under King <span class="smcap">William III.</span>, <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>, <span class="smcap">Abercromby</span>,
<span class="smcap">Moore</span>, and <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, the most celebrated
warriors and consummate generals of their periods;
thus establishing a fame and distinction which, it is
presumed, few, if any, other military bodies in Europe
can claim. The career of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> has
not evinced a feverish and uncertain valour, sometimes
emitting sudden flashes which startle and surprise, and
at others betraying weakness and pusillanimity, but it
has proved uniform and invincible; and whether employed
against the barbarous tribes of Asia, Africa, and
America, or the disciplined legions of Europe, the officers
and men of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> have, on all occasions,
displayed the native energy, firmness, and contempt of
danger peculiar to Britons; and by their victories in every
quarter of the globe, they have established a reputation
for future ages to emulate.</p>

<p>Posterity, looking back at the splendid achievements
of the British arms in various parts of the world, will
naturally inquire what regiments won honour and fame in
the several fields of glory where British valour was sternly
proved. To this it may be answered that, in the seventeenth
century, when <span class="smcap">Gustavus Adolphus</span> stood forth
the champion of the Protestant princes of Germany, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
regiment fought and conquered in that glorious cause;
and it claims the honour of having fought at the battle
of <span class="smcap">Leipsic</span>, famous in the history of Sweden, and at
<span class="smcap">Roucroy</span>, celebrated in the annals of France.</p>

<p>In the succeeding century, when the balance of power
in Europe was destroyed by the union of France and
Spain, and <span class="smcap">Louis XIV.</span> sought to dictate laws to Christendom,
this regiment was one of the first which appeared
at the scene of conflict, and it shared in the victories of
<span class="smcap">Blenheim</span>, <span class="smcap">Ramilies</span>, <span class="smcap">Oudenarde</span>, and <span class="smcap">Malplaquet</span>,
also in the honour of capturing the fortresses which that
ambitious monarch had erected as bulwarks to his kingdom;
and thus purchased peace for Europe.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Bonaparte</span>, whose hatred and jealousy of
England were unalterable, sought to become more than
the dictator of Europe, this regiment met the legions
of the usurper, and fought and triumphed in battles,
which are inscribed on its colours as monuments to
stimulate to deeds of valour the men of future generations,
who shall enrol themselves under the banners of the
<span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>. Besides these leading features of its
career, in which the national character and influence
have been elevated, this regiment has evinced equally
brilliant qualities in actions which, though less important
in their bearing on the affairs of Europe, have attested
the intrinsic merit of the corps, and have purchased
numerous advantages to the commerce, power, stability,
and happiness of Britain.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Gustavus Adolphus King of Sweden was born on the 9th
of December, 1594. He learnt the duty of a musketeer as soon
as he could carry a musket; and when seventeen years of age
he was Colonel of a Cavalry corps, and served a campaign
against the Danes. In the same year (1611) his father died, and
the young Gustavus succeeded to the throne of Sweden; and he
soon afterwards evinced, to the surprise of all Europe, the most
distinguished abilities as a commander, a hero, and a politician.
The discipline which he introduced into his army was strict
beyond all precedent, and to this many of his victories may be
attributed. His improvements in arms, equipment, and in military
tactics, were particularly important; and he was brave even
to rashness. He was wounded in action on six different occasions,
had three horses killed under him, and was several times
in the power of the enemy, but was rescued by his own men. On
the fatal 6th of November, 1632, he fought sword in hand at the
head of the Smoland cavalry, and was shot through the left arm,
but continued fighting until his voice and strength failed from loss
of blood, when he attempted to retire. At that instant an Imperial
cavalier came galloping forward, and, crying "<em>Long have I
sought thee</em>," shot the King through the body; and the next
moment one of his Majesty's attendants shot the cavalier dead
on the spot. As the King and his attendants were retiring, they
were charged by a troop of cuirassiers; his Majesty was held
for a few moments on the saddle, but his horse, being shot in the
shoulder, made a desperate plunge, and threw the rider to the
ground. After his fall the King received five wounds in different
parts of his body, and was shot through the head. Thus fell the
brave Gustavus, the most distinguished warrior of his age; with
whose life the early services of <span class="smcap">Hepburn's</span> regiment, now represented
by the <span class="smcap">First, or Royal Regiment of Foot</span>, are intimately
connected.</p></div>

designated the <em>Royal Regiment</em>. There was also at this period a
<em>Royal Regiment</em> in <em>Ireland</em>, which was sometimes styled Foot
Guards. This corps adhered to King James II. at the Revolution
in 1688. One battalion had previously arrived in England,
and, being composed of papists, it was disbanded by William III.
The men were confined a short time in the Isle of Wight, and
afterwards transferred to the service of the Emperor of Germany.
The other battalion fought in the cause of James II. in Ireland,
until the surrender of Limerick in 1691, when it proceeded to
France, and remained in the French service until it was disbanded.</p></div>

May, 1811, on the health of the Duke of Kent, the Colonel of the
<span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment, being drunk, his Royal Highness rose to return
thanks, and, in the course of his speech, said:&mdash;"My royal
brother has been pleased to praise the regiment in which I have
been employed, and have had the honour to command, and I
too can bear testimony to the spirit and gallantry of the
Scottish soldiers. From the earliest days, when I commenced
my military life, it was always my utmost aim to arrive at the
command of a Scots regiment, and to bring that regiment into
action would have been the greatest glory I could have attained,
as I am well convinced the officers and men would have justified
my most sanguine expectations; their courage, perseverance,
and activity, being undoubtedly such as may always be
relied on; and they are always able and willing to do their
duty, if not more than their duty." His Royal Highness took
great interest in the welfare of the regiment; and he this year
presented, by the hands of Lieut.-Colonel M'Leod, a gold medal
to Serjeant Manns of the regiment, for the very meritorious manner
in which he had educated upwards of 800 soldiers and soldiers'
children.</p></div>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">His Royal Highness the Prince Regent</span>, taking into
His Royal Highness's consideration the highly distinguished
services of <span class="smcap">Colonel James Stevenson Barns</span>, Lieut.-Colonel
of the 1st, or <span class="smcap">Royal Scots Regiment of Foot</span>, Companion of
the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath, and Knight
of the Royal Portuguese Order of the Tower and Sword, manifested
by him on divers important occasions in the campaigns
of Toulon, Corsica, Holland, Egypt, and during the recent
arduous operations and splendid achievements of His Majesty's
arms in Portugal, Spain, and France, and being desirous of
conferring upon that officer such a mark of favour as may in
an especial manner evince the sense his Royal Highness entertains
of the intrepidity and valour displayed by him at the
battle of Busaco, wherein, as Lieut.-Colonel of the Staff, he
commanded a brigade; at the capture of Badajoz, on the
6th of April, 1812; at the victory of Salamanca, where,
in leading his battalion to the charge, he was severely wounded;
and his distinguished gallantry at the assault and capture of
St. Sebastian, and the battles of the Nive, hath been pleased,
in the name and on the behalf of His Majesty, to grant unto the
said Colonel Barns, His Majesty's Royal license and authority
that he and his descendants may bear the following honourable
augmentation to the arms of his family:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"A chief, thereon the representation of the curtain of a fortification;
and above the words 'St. Sebastian,' as also a canton
charged, with the representations of the gold cross presented by
His Majesty's command to the said James Stevenson Barns,
and of the badge of the Royal Portuguese Military Order of the
Tower and Sword pendant from the ribands from which the
said distinctions are respectively attached.
</p>
<p>
"And the following crest of honourable augmentation:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Issuant from a broken battlement, a dexter arm in armour,
the hand grasping a banner inscribed 'St. Sebastian;' in allusion
to the conspicuous conduct of the said Colonel Barns,
on the 31st of August, 1813, when he gallantly led the
3rd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>, and assaulted and carried the
curtain of the fortress, thereby eminently contributing to the
ultimate capture of that important place; provided the said
armorial distinctions be first duly exemplified, according to our
law of arms, and recorded in the Herald's Office; otherwise His
Majesty's royal license and permission to be void, and of none
effect."</p></div>

preparations were made to crucify them, but, after an hour's suspense,
they were sent away from the river, and eventually forwarded
in chains to the capital, a distance of 300 miles. On
reaching Ava they were thrown into a loathsome dungeon,
crowded with criminals and deserters, where the Doctor remained
five, and Lieutenant Bennett ten days, with nothing but a little
rice to support them, and even this was occasionally omitted.
After being released from gaol they were kept separate. The
Doctor was a prisoner at large in the house of an American missionary
(Mr. Price), and the king's interpreter; and Lieutenant
Bennett was placed under charge of a Burmese constable, and
was in chains in a lonely situation during the troubled and fearful
state of Ava. From the vindictive and sanguinary disposition
of some of the Burmese ministers and chiefs, the lives of the prisoners
were in constant jeopardy, particularly during the moments
of excitement produced by disastrous intelligence from the
army. The prisoners had also to dread that, through the influence
and fury of the Queen and Priests, they should be sacrificed
as a propitiatory offering to the Burmese gods. On the nearer
approach of the British army, the Doctor and Lieutenant Bennett
were frequently consulted on European modes of concluding
treaties of peace; and the Burmese acknowledged they could not
reconcile to their minds the idea that a victorious army, with
nothing to impede its progress, should halt within a day or two's
march of the capital, and terminate the war on conditions; this
was not Burman custom. To use their own simile, they could
not believe the cat with the mouse in her claws would refrain
from demolishing it; and, therefore, they concluded the pecuniary
demand of the English general was merely a ruse to obtain as
much precious metal as possible, and afterwards as much territory
would be retained as was deemed convenient. To raise their
opinion of British faith, the Doctor engaged to convey a letter to the
British camp, and to return of his own accord, and his re-appearance
astonished the Burmese ministers, and whole population of Ava.
</p>
<p>
Lieutenant (now Major) Bennett wrote an interesting narrative
of the various scenes and incidents he met with, all of a
novel and singular nature, and exhibiting traits and peculiarities
of the Burman character, which his situation as a prisoner of war
could alone develope. This narrative was published in the first and
second volumes of the United Service Journal.</p></div>

to the Colonel of the Royal Regiment</cite>:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="right">"Bangalore, East Indies, 30th July, 1830.</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Lord Duke</span>,
</p>
<p>
"The 2nd battalion of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> having been
under my command for nearly five years, I cannot allow it to
march from Bangalore without conveying to your grace the
high opinion I entertain of it both collectively and individually.
Its zeal and good conduct as soldiers have been equally conspicuous
as its anxiety to produce harmony and good fellowship
in society; and it will leave a lasting impression upon the
inhabitants of this place, which has been marked in a most
flattering manner.
</p>
<p>
"This battalion has of late been commanded by a particular
friend of mine (Lieut.-Colonel Wetherall), in a manner which
has produced the goodwill of his officers and soldiers in an
eminent degree, and placed the battalion in the highest state of
discipline; and I only regret that your grace cannot see it in
the state in which it leaves this station, which, after a service
in India of 23 years, has, I believe, astonished our Commander-in-Chief,
who is now here.
</p>
<p>
"The corps of officers is highly respectable, and amongst them
are some of the finest young men in the army. I am, therefore,
confident that, under your grace's protection, the 2nd battalion
of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> will very soon rival our best regiments in England.
</p>
<p>
"I trust your grace will excuse this long intrusion; I sincerely
hope that you enjoy your health; and I have the honour to be,

<p>
"My Lord Duke,
"Your faithful and obedient servant,

<h2>SUCCESSION OF COLONELS<br />

OF THE<br />

<span class="smcap">FIRST, or ROYAL REGIMENT of FOOT</span>.</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sir John Hepburn</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 26th January, 1633</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hepburn</span><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> descended from the Hepburns of Bothwell,
an ancient and distinguished family, which for many ages had
extensive possessions in East Lothian. His father was proprietor
of the lands of Althestaneford, and gave young Hepburn
a liberal education. From his earliest youth he was remarkable
for spirit and resolution. When he quitted college he
made the tour of part of Europe (in 1615), and the rising fame
of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, of whose character he heard
frequent commendations, gave birth to a spark of military
ardour within his breast which was never extinguished till his
death. Soon after his return from his travels, when the attempt
was made to rescue Bohemia from the power of Austria,
he engaged in the cause of liberty, and commanded a company
of foot at several sieges and actions in Bohemia, Alsace, and
Germany, and at the battle near Fleurus. When the King of
Bohemia's forces were disbanded, he entered the service of the
Swedish monarch. In his first essay in arms he displayed an
ardour which procured him the favour and approbation of Gustavus,
whose vigilant eye soon detected in this aspiring youth all
the qualities requisite to constitute an excellent soldier. After a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>short service in the subordinate commissions he was quickly advanced
to the command of a regiment, and was employed in
services which required a considerable portion of skill and valour.
He was invariably either at the head of his regiment, or at the
head of the brigade of which his regiment formed part, and, as
his regiment was incorporated into a Scots corps in the French
service, now the <span class="smcap">First, or Royal Regiment of Foot</span>, his
services are set forth in the historical record of this corps,
where his name will be found associated with deeds of valour
and heroism of particular brilliancy. He appears to have
been celebrated equally for bravery, skill, and humanity: he
was beloved and esteemed by Gustavus Adolphus, and also by
his companions in arms, both officers and soldiers; and his
presence inspired confidence in the ranks of the brave Scots
who fought under his command.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>That innate spirit and fire which constituted a part of his
character, rendered him incapable of brooking even an imaginary
injury; and Gustavus Adolphus, who was equally
remarkable for the fiery temperament of his constitution,
having uttered one or two sharp expressions to the brave
Scottish warrior, he declared he would never more unsheath
his sword in the Swedish quarrel. The king is said to have
placed more confidence in this officer than in any other colonel
in the Swedish army; and some days before their disagreement
his Majesty had appointed him to the command of half the
infantry in the camp at Nuremberg. The king afterwards
made several condescensions to Hepburn, and appeared particularly
desirous of retaining this valuable officer in his
service; but the Scottish hero was inflexible, and he quitted
the Swedish army in 1632. On his arrival at the British
court, his fame having preceded him, he was knighted. He
soon afterwards tendered his services to the king of France,
who was too well acquainted with the character, capabilities,
and experience of this renowned Scot, not to give him employment,
and he was placed at the head of a regiment, constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
of some new levies and old Scots companies in the French
service, now the <span class="smcap">First, or Royal Regiment of Foot</span>, in the
<span class="smcap">British</span> line. His commission was dated the 26th of January,
1633; and at the head of this corps he distinguished himself
in Alsace and Germany, and had the satisfaction of seeing
many of the veterans of his former regiment incorporated in his
new corps. He commanded a division of the French army on
the Rhine, and was on the point of being advanced to the
dignity of a Marshal of France; but he was killed at the siege
of Saverne, before the diploma reached him. Thus terminated
the career of one of the best officers Scotland ever produced.
He was known in France by the title of the <span class="smcap">Chevalier
Hebron</span>; and such was the fame of his gallantry, that,
although he was killed in the reign of Louis XIII., a monument
was erected to his memory some years afterwards by
Louis XIV., in the cathedral of Toul. A contemporary historian
(Lithgow) states "<em>he was one of the best soldiers in
Christendom, and, consequently, in the world</em>."</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">James Hepburn</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 26th August, 1636</em>.</h3>

<p>This officer was cousin to Sir John Hepburn, and heir
apparent of the ancient house of Wachton. He was one of the
gallant Scots, who, led by a native ardour for military fame,
sought renown in foreign lands, and fought under the great
Gustavus Adolphus in the glorious attempt made by that monarch
to rescue the Protestant princes of Germany from the
power of the emperor. In toils, dangers, and triumphs, he was
the companion of Sir John Hepburn. He rose to the rank of
Lieut.-Colonel in the Swedish army; and having transferred
his services to the crown of France, he succeeded Sir John
Hepburn in the Colonelcy of the Scots corps, now the <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment</span>. He was killed in action in Lorraine a few months
afterwards; but the particular circumstances connected with
his fall have not been ascertained.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lord James Douglas</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed in 1637</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord James Douglas</span>, second son of William, first Marquis
of Douglas, acquired celebrity in the wars between the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
of Austria and the Protestant league, and distinguished himself
in France, Flanders, Italy, and Germany. He obtained the
Colonelcy of the Scots corps, now the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment of
Foot</span>, in 1637; and was killed while in the command of a
flying camp between Douay and Arras in October, 1655. A
monument was erected to his memory in the church of St.
Germain de Prez, at Paris, with an inscription in Latin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lord George Douglas</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 21st October, 1655</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord George Douglas</span> was the son of William, first Marquis
of Douglas, by his second wife Mary, daughter of George, first
Marquis of Huntly. In his youth he was page of honour to
Louis XIV. Having made choice of the profession of arms,
he entered the service of the king of France, and succeeded his
brother in the Colonelcy of the Scots Regiment, now the
<span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, in the British line. In 1672 he served
with the French army in the Netherlands, and was attached to
the division commanded by Marshal Turenne. He afterwards
served several campaigns with the French army on the Rhine;
highly distinguished himself in the defence of Treves, and
was promoted to the rank of Major-General in France. He
was created <span class="smcap">Earl of Dumbarton</span> on the 9th of March, 1675.</p>

<p>In the early part of the reign of King James II. the Earl of
Dumbarton was Commander-in-Chief in Scotland; and he
commanded the troops which suppressed the rebellion of the
Earl of Argyle in the summer of 1685. He was subsequently
elected a Knight Companion of the Order of the Thistle. He
held the rank of Lieut.-General in England, and was second
in command of the army encamped on Hounslow Heath in
1687 and 1688. At the Revolution he adhered to King
James II., whom he followed to France, where he died in 1692.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Frederick Duke Schomberg</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 31st December, 1688</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Frederick de Schomberg</span> descended from an ancient and
noble family of that name of the Palatinate, or Lower Rhine;
and, during the struggle made by the Protestant states of
Europe against the power of Austria and Spain, he served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
under Frederick Henry Prince of Orange, after whose death
he engaged in the service of the King of France.</p>

<p>Portugal, after having been subject to Spain many years,
asserted its independence in 1640; and a sanguinary war
commenced between the two kingdoms. The Spaniards had
penetrated into the heart of Portugal, and were anticipating
its speedy subjugation, when Louis XIV. sent General
de Schomberg secretly to the aid of the house of Braganza.
He was already famous for his successful defence of Bourbourg
against two powerful armies, and for his conduct in the wars
in Rouissillon; and, when placed at the head of the Portuguese
forces, his name at once aroused the desponding adherents of
the Braganza family, and inspired them with new hopes and
new expectations. While his presence infused courage into
the army, his discretion, for which he was always remarkable,
directed its energies to advantage; towns were taken, battles
were won, and finally a powerful army headed by Don John
of Austria was defeated, and the Spanish monarch forced, in
1668, to acknowledge the independence of Portugal, and to
conclude a peace with the house of Braganza. His success
excited the surprise of Europe, and his achievements were
celebrated by poets and orators in several languages.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>After his success in Portugal he commanded a French
force against the Spaniards in Catalonia; and his merits
became so conspicuous, that in 1675 he was promoted by
Louis XIV. to the dignity of a marshal of France. He subsequently
commanded the French army in the Netherlands,
and in 1676 he forced the Prince of Orange to raise the siege
of Maestricht. In a few years afterwards the king of France
endeavoured to suppress the Protestant religion in his kingdom,
when Marshal de Schomberg, refusing to become a papist,
his services appear to have been, to a certain extent, forgotten.
Various means had formerly been used, and prospects of
advancement to the highest honours held out, to induce him to
change his religion, but in vain; and he now obtained liberty
to quit France on condition of his proceeding to Portugal.
Soon afterwards he obtained permission to proceed to Germany;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
and the emperor designed to have placed this distinguished
veteran at the head of his armies, but was prevented by the
influence of the Jesuits. The Elector of Brandenburg availed
himself of the services of Marshal de Schomberg, and appointed
him a minister of state, and Generalissimo of Prussia.</p>

<p>When William Prince of Orange (afterwards William III.)
was preparing an army for a descent on Britain, to oppose the
proceedings of James II., his Highness was desirous of obtaining
the services of Marshal de Schomberg, who was considered
one of the greatest captains of his time, and, being devoted to
the Protestant interest, he consented to accompany the Prince.
The success which attended this enterprise enabled his
Highness to reward the veteran commander, who was appointed
Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, and Master-General of the
Ordnance. He was also constituted a Knight of the Garter,
and created Baron of Teyes, Earl of Brentford, Marquis of
Harwich, and <span class="smcap">Duke Schomberg</span>. During the summer of
1689 he was sent Commander-in-Chief to Ireland to relieve
the persecuted Protestants, and to rescue that kingdom from
the power of King James; and he was killed at the battle of
the Boyne, in July, 1690, while gallantly advancing with a
regiment of foot to charge the enemy. Thus terminated the
life of this distinguished veteran in the 84th year of his age.
He was buried at St. Patrick's, Dublin, where a stone with an
inscription was placed over his tomb by the Dean and Chapter
of the church.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Douglas</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 5th March, 1691</em>.</h3>

<p>Amongst the many officers which Scotland has produced,
who have signalized themselves in war, few have evinced
brighter military virtues than the brave <span class="smcap">Sir Robert Douglas</span>
of Glenbervie. He was second cousin to the Earl of Dumbarton;
he served many years in the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, in which
he rose to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel; and he was known as a
brave and generous aspirant to military fame, when King William
III. promoted him to the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>.
Bright prospects of future glory were before him. He had
already given astonishing proofs of personal bravery at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
battle of <span class="smcap">Steenkirk</span>, when he saw one of the colours of his
regiment in the hands of the French. He instantly rushed
forward into the thickest of the enemy's ranks, and rescued the
colour at the expense of his life, as more fully detailed in the
historical record of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>. He lived beloved
and admired, and fell regretted by his sovereign and country,
but more particularly by the officers and men of his regiment,
with whom he had served in various parts of the world, and in
whose breasts his memory was cherished with particular
tenderness. By his fall he purchased a renown which more
fortunate commanders have failed to acquire; and the story of
his gallantry will survive to the remotest ages.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lord George Hamilton</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 1st August, 1692</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord George Hamilton</span>, fifth son of William Duke of
Hamilton, was an officer in the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> in the reign
of Charles II., and also of James II.,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and, adhering to the
Protestant interest at the Revolution in 1688, he was advanced
to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, and on the 1st of March, 1690, to
the brevet rank of Colonel. He served under King William III.
in Ireland, and distinguished himself at the battle of the Boyne;
and in 1691 he was at the siege of Athlone, at the battle of
Aghrim, and at the capture of Limerick. In January, 1692,
he was appointed Colonel of the 7th Royal Fusiliers, at the
head of which corps he distinguished himself at the battle of
Steenkirk, and his gallantry was rewarded with the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>. Continuing to serve under King
William in the Netherlands, he distinguished himself in 1693 at
the unfortunate battle of Landen, and in 1695 at the siege and
capture of Namur, and while engaged in this service he was
promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General. On the 3rd of
January, 1696, he was advanced to the peerage by the title of
Baron Dechmont, Viscount of Kirkwall, and <span class="smcap">Earl of Orkney</span>;
and in March, 1702, he was promoted to the rank of Major-General.
He served the campaign of this year under the Earl of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>Marlborough, and was engaged in the siege of Stevenswart.
He commanded a brigade of infantry during the campaign of
1703, was advanced to the rank of Lieut.-General, and invested
with the Order of the Thistle in 1704; and, having proceeded
with the army into the heart of Germany, took part in gaining
the glorious victories of Schellenberg and Blenheim. In 1705
he distinguished himself at the siege and capture of Huy; and
in the following year at the battle of Ramilies, and the siege of
Menin. He also took a distinguished part in the battle of
Oudenarde; in covering the siege of Lisle; and in forcing the
passage of the Scheldt in 1708. In 1709 he distinguished
himself in the movements which preceded and led to the
battle of Malplaquet, and during this hard contested action he
signalized himself at the head of fifteen battalions of infantry.
He also signalized himself at the siege of Douay in 1710; and
in the beginning of the following year he was promoted to the
rank of General. He was also engaged in passing the French
lines in 1711, and commanded twenty battalions of infantry
at the siege of Bouchain.</p>

<p>On these occasions the <span class="smcap">Earl of Orkney</span> had evinced
personal bravery and military talents of a superior character.
At the close of the war he was a member of the Privy Council,
and Governor of Edinburgh Castle. On the accession of
George I. he was appointed one of the Lords of the Bedchamber
to His Majesty, and Governor of Virginia; and in
January, 1736, he was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal.
He was many years one of the sixteen representatives of the
Scottish peerage, and died in January, 1737.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Honourable James St. Clair</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 27th June, 1737</em>.</h3>

<p>This officer entered the army in the reign of Queen Anne,
and had the honour of serving under the celebrated John
Duke of Marlborough. He was several years in the 3rd Foot
Guards; and in 1722 he obtained the brevet rank of Colonel.
In October, 1734, King George II. appointed him Colonel of
the 22nd Foot; and in 1737 promoted him to the Colonelcy of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>. He obtained the rank of Brigadier-General
in 1739, that of Major-General in 1741, and Lieut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>-General
in June, 1745, at which time he was performing the
duty of Quarter-Master General to the army in the Netherlands,
commanded by his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland.
In the following year he commanded an expedition
which was originally designed for an attack on the French
settlements in Canada; but was countermanded, and afterwards
made an attack on the French sea-port L'Orient, and on the
peninsula of Quiberon.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> He was subsequently employed on
an embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> On the decease
of his brother in 1750, he became entitled to the dignity
of Lord Sinclair, a Scottish peerage; but he preferred a seat
in the House of Commons, of which he had been many years
a member, and he therefore did not assume the title. He was
promoted to the rank of General in 1761, and died at Dysart
in November, 1762.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Erskine, Bart.</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 17th December, 1762</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Erskine</span> was an officer of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>,
in which corps he was appointed Captain on the 12th March,
1743; in April, 1746, he was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel,
and held the appointment of Deputy Quarter-Master
General to the expedition under Lieut.-General St. Clair,
which made a descent on the French coast, in which service
he was wounded. In June, 1759, he was promoted to the
rank of Major-General; and in October, 1760, he obtained
the Colonelcy of the 67th regiment, from which he was
removed in 1761 to the 25th Regiment, and in 1762 to the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royals</span>. He was a Member of Parliament,
and Secretary to the Order of the Thistle, and died in August,
1765.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">John Marquis of Lorne</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 11th September, 1765</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">John Campbell</span> entered the army in the reign of King George
II., and was appointed Lieut.-Colonel of the 54th Regiment,

and served a short time on the Continent. The rebellion
breaking out in Scotland in the same year, he quitted
the Netherlands, and joined General Hawley with 1000
Argyleshire highlanders in January, 1746, on the day of the
unfortunate battle of Falkirk. He subsequently joined the
Duke of Cumberland at Perth, and accompanied his Royal
Highness to the north. In November, 1755, he was promoted
to the rank of Colonel, and appointed Aide-de-camp to the
King. In the following month he obtained the Colonelcy of
the 54th Regiment, then first embodied, from which he was
removed in April, 1757, to the 14th Dragoons, and two years
afterwards he was promoted to the rank of Major-General, and
appointed Colonel of the Argyleshire Fencibles. In January,
1761, he was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General. On the
decease of his uncle, Archibald, third Duke of Argyle, in 1761,
his father, General John Campbell, of the Scots Greys, succeeded
to that title, and Lieut.-General Campbell of the 14th
Dragoons obtained the designation of <span class="smcap">Marquis of Lorne</span>.
In 1762 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief in Scotland,
and in 1765 he obtained the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
of Foot. He was again appointed Commander-in-Chief in
Scotland in 1767, and in 1770 he succeeded to the title of
<span class="smcap">Duke of Argyle</span>. In March, 1778, he was promoted to the
rank of General; four years afterwards he was removed from
the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> to the 3rd Foot Guards, and he was advanced to
the rank of Field Marshal in 1796. The many virtues for
which his Grace was distinguished occasioned him to be highly
honoured and respected in society; and he died lamented on
the 24th of May, 1806, in the 83rd year of his age.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lord Adam Gordon</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 9th May, 1782</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Adam Gordon</span>, fourth son of Alexander second Duke
of Gordon, was appointed Captain in the 18th Royal Irish
Regiment of Foot on the 12th of December, 1746, and Captain
and Lieut.-Colonel in the Third Foot Guards on the 2nd of
January, 1756. In 1758 he proceeded with the expedition

capture of Cherbourg, and the descent on the coast of Brittany,
and distinguished himself at the head of his company while
bringing up the rear of the army when attacked by the enemy
during the embarkation at St. Cass. He was promoted to the
Colonelcy of the 66th Regiment in January, 1763, and subsequently
held a command in North America. In May, 1772,
he was promoted to the rank of Major-General; in December,
1775, he was removed to the 26th Cameronians; and in the
following year he rose to the rank of Lieut.-General. He was
appointed Governor of Tynemouth Castle in 1778; was removed

in Scotland in 1789. He was further promoted
to the rank of General in 1793, and in 1796 he was appointed
Governor of Edinburgh Castle. He was several years a Member

His decease took place in August, 1801.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 21st August, 1801</em>.</h3>

<p>During the early part of this century the <span class="smcap">Royal</span> Regiment
of Foot had the honour of being commanded by a Prince who
was distinguished alike for his social and military virtues,&mdash;namely,
<span class="smcap">Field Marshal His Royal Highness Edward
Duke of Kent</span> and <span class="smcap">Strathearn</span>, the father of <span class="smcap">Her Most
Gracious Majesty the Queen Victoria</span>.</p>

<p>Prince Edward, fourth son of His Majesty King George III.,
was born on the 2nd of November, 1767. In the eighteenth
year of his age he proceeded to Germany for the completion
of his studies, and resided successively at Lunenburg and
Hanover, and was appointed, on the 30th of May, 1786,
Colonel of the Hanoverian Guards. During the succeeding
year he removed to Geneva, and while pursuing his studies
at this place, His Majesty conferred upon him the Colonelcy
of the 7th Royal Fusiliers. Early in 1790 he returned to
England; and after passing a few days with his family he
embarked, in obedience to the King's command, for Gibraltar,
in order to acquire a knowledge of garrison duty under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
Major-General O'Hara. While at Gibraltar he commanded
for several months the 2nd, or Queen's Regiment, until the
arrival of the 7th Royal Fusiliers, as a reinforcement to the
garrison, in August, 1790. In 1791 he sailed with his regiment
from Gibraltar for Quebec; and while serving in Canada
he was promoted to the rank of Major-General. From North
America he proceeded, during the winter of 1793-4, through
the United States to Boston, where he embarked for the West
Indies, and joined the army under General Sir Charles Grey,
at the commencement of the siege of Fort Bourbon, in the
island of Martinique, and commanded the detached camp at
La Coste, above Point &agrave; Petre. During the several attacks His
Royal Highness's conduct excited the admiration of the army:
his life was frequently exposed to the most imminent peril; and
his aides-de-camp, Captain, afterwards General Sir Frederick,
Wetherall, and Lieutenant Vesey, were wounded near his
Royal Highness's person.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In compliment to the gallantry
evinced by His Royal Highness on this occasion, the lower
fort, called Fort Royal, was subsequently named <span class="smcap">Fort
Edward</span>.</p>

<p>After the capture of Martinique, the army proceeded to St.
Lucie; and His Royal Highness commanded the grenadier
brigade, which, in conjunction with the light infantry brigade,
under Major-General Thomas Dundas, formed the storming-party
which carried Morne Fortun&eacute;. From St. Lucie the army
proceeded to the island of Guadaloupe; and the flank companies
were detached under Prince Edward and Major-General
Dundas, who succeeded in gaining possession of Morne Marscot
and Fleur D'Ep&eacute;e, commanding Point &agrave; Petre. His conduct
again excited admiration, and His Royal Highness received
the thanks of Parliament. After the capture of the
French West India Islands<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>, His Royal Highness returned to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>North America, and was shortly afterwards appointed Commander
of the Forces in Nova Scotia and its dependencies.
On the 12th of January, 1796, he was promoted to the rank
of Lieut.-General; and, having returned to England on account
of ill health, he was created, on the 23rd of April, 1799,
<em>Earl of Dublin</em>, in Ireland, and <span class="smcap">Duke of Kent and Strathearn</span>,
in Great Britain; in the following month he was
promoted to the rank of General, and appointed Commander-in-Chief
of all the forces in British North America. On
his return to North America his arrival was greeted by all
ranks; and during his stay in that country he introduced
numerous improvements in the system of conducting public
business. In August, 1800, His Royal Highness returned to
England; and in the following year he was appointed to the
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> of Foot. In 1802 he was
appointed Governor of the important fortress of Gibraltar,
whither he immediately proceeded; and while attempting to
effect the removal of several long-existing abuses and irregularities,
His Royal Highness experienced that opposition which
has attended every attempt to remedy evils, when the private
interests and privileges of individuals are concerned. The
Duke of Kent returned in 1803 to England, where he continued
to reside upwards of fifteen years. He was promoted
to the rank of Field-Marshal on the 5th of September, 1805;
he was also elected a Knight of the Garter; constituted a
Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order
of the Bath; and appointed Keeper and Ranger of Hampton
Court Park.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<p>During the period His Royal Highness resided in England
the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span> of Foot experienced the advantage of
his constant care and anxiety for its interests, and of his influence
in the kingdom. It was recruited with facility, and he
had the satisfaction of having four battalions on foreign service,
amounting to 5000 men, at the same time in three different
quarters of the globe. The attachment of His Royal Highness
to his corps was evinced on all occasions, and he frequently
expressed himself in terms of exultation at its achievements.
His concern was not, however, limited to his regiment, as
there was scarcely a public charity in the metropolis which did
not derive benefit from his patronage, personal eloquence, and
contributions, and over many he presided. His private acts
of benevolence, in the cases of widows and orphans who were
known to His Royal Highness as deserving objects of relief,
were very numerous, and the instances of his charity and
philanthropy were attested by the grateful acknowledgments
of those who had no claim on His Royal Highness's bounty
beyond the circumstance of a husband, father, or other relative,
having performed faithful service under his command.
The provision made by His Majesty's Government for His
Royal Highness had not been equal to his necessary expenditure
to support the dignity of a Prince of the royal blood,
particularly for the periods he was on foreign service; and in
1816 economical views induced him to proceed to the Continent.
In May, 1818, he was married at Coburg, according
to the Lutheran rites, to Her Serene Highness Victoria Maria
Louisa, youngest daughter of the late reigning Duke of Saxe-Coburg.
Shortly after the solemnities the royal pair proceeded
to England, and were remarried at Kew Palace on the
11th of July, 1818, according to the rites of the Church of
England. In a few weeks after this ceremony the Duke returned
with his bride to the Continent; in the succeeding year
they revisited England; and on the 24th of May, 1819, the
Duchess gave birth, at Kensington Palace, to a daughter,
named Alexandrina Victoria, Her present Majesty.</p>

<p>In a few months after this happy event this amiable Prince,
whose social, private, and public virtues endeared him to his
family and friends, and procured him a place in the affections
of the British people, was attacked by pulmonary inflamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>tion,
produced by accidental cold, and he died at his temporary
residence at Sidmouth on the 23rd of January, 1820.
The remains of His Royal Highness were removed from Sidmouth
and deposited in the royal vault at St. George's Chapel,
in Windsor Castle, on the 12th of February, 1820, with the
usual honours and solemnities observed at the funerals of the
members of the Royal Family.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">George Marquis of Huntly</span>,<br />

<em>Appointed 29th January, 1820</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">George Marquis of Huntly</span>, son of Alexander fourth Duke
of Gordon, was appointed to a commission in the 35th Regiment
in 1790. He soon afterwards raised an independent
company of foot, and was appointed, on the 25th of January,
1791, Captain in the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment. In
July, 1792, he was appointed Captain-Lieutenant and Lieut.-Colonel
in the 3rd Foot Guards; and, proceeding with his
company to the Netherlands in the following year, he was
engaged with the French at St. Amand and Famars, and in
the siege of Valenciennes; also in the action before Dunkirk,
and the affair at Lannoy. In the beginning of 1794 his
Lordship raised the 100th (afterwards 92nd) regiment, of
which he was appointed Lieut.-Colonel Commandant; and he
proceeded with his regiment to Gibraltar, but on his return to
England he was captured by a French privateer. He subsequently
rejoined his regiment at the island of Corsica, where
he served upwards of a year, and obtained the rank of Colonel
on the 3rd of May, 1796. He was soon afterwards appointed
Brigadier-General in Ireland, where he served during the
rebellion. In 1799 he proceeded with the expedition to Holland,
and was actively employed until the 2nd of October,
when he was wounded. His Lordship was promoted in 1801
to the rank of Major-General; and in 1803 he was appointed
to the Staff in North Britain, where he served three years.
In January, 1806, he was removed to the Colonelcy of the
42nd Royal Highlanders; and on the 25th of April, 1808,
he was promoted to the rank of Lieut.-General. He commanded
a division of the army in the expedition to Walcheren
in 1809, and was promoted to the rank of General on the 12th
of August, 1819. In the following year he obtained the Colo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>nelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Royal Regiment</span>, and was constituted a Knight
Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the
Bath about five months afterwards. He succeeded, on the
decease of his father, in 1827, to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Duke of
Gordon</span>, and was also appointed Governor of Edinburgh
Castle, and Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland; and in
1834 he was removed from the <span class="smcap">Royals</span> to the 3rd Foot Guards.
This kind-hearted and gallant nobleman and soldier, who was
distinguished for an uninterrupted succession of acts of kindness
and philanthropy, died on the 28th of May, 1836.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Thomas Lord Lynedoch</span>, G.C.B.,<br />

<em>Appointed 12th December, 1834</em>.</h3>

<p>Amongst the most distinguished of the able and scientific
soldiers who led the conquering armies of England from the
Tagus to the Seine, was the venerable General Lord Lynedoch,
whose death took place on the 18th December, 1843,
at his residence in London.</p>

<p>The early life of this eminent man was that of a private
country gentleman, but one whose mind had been cultivated
in no ordinary degree. The classical attainments of his father,
and the many elegant accomplishments of his mother, were
directed to that which formed with them a never ceasing
object, namely, the education of their son, who, owing to the
death of both his elder brothers, had become heir to the
family estate. The family from which he is descended, is a
branch of that from which the Dukes of Montrose trace their
origin. His father was Thomas Graham, Esq., of Balgowan,
and his mother was Christiana, fourth daughter of the first
Earl of Hopetoun. He was born at Balgowan (Perthshire),
in the year 1750. In 1774 his father died, and, in the same
year, he married the Hon. Mary Cathcart, one of the three
daughters of the ninth Lord Cathcart. Thus Mr. Thomas
Graham apparently settled down for life in the quiet, unobtrusive,
happy condition of an independent country gentleman;
and thus he continued in the enjoyment of great domestic
felicity, surrounded by many estimable and attached friends,
for a period of nearly 20 years. He had by this time attained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the mature age of forty-two, and to all external seeming was
one of the last men in the world likely to enter upon a
military life.</p>

<p>In the year 1792, however, his domestic happiness was
brought to a termination by the death of his wife. The effect
of this melancholy event unsettled the mind of Mr. Graham,
and his case adds one to the instances that might be adduced
in which domestic calamities have procured, for the State,
services of the highest order in the field and the cabinet. It
may be said, that this change in his condition and prospects,
imparted almost a romantic character to the tenor of his life.
His grief was such as injured his health, and he was recommended
to travel, with a view of alleviating the one, and
restoring the other, by change of scene and variety of objects.
While at Gibraltar in 1793, he was led into military society,
and from that period he commenced to devote himself to the
profession of arms.</p>

<p>Lord Hood was then about to sail for the south of France,
and Mr. Graham had recently been a traveller in that country.
He therefore gladly acceded to his proposition to accompany
him as a volunteer. In the year 1793, he landed with the
British troops at Toulon, and served as extra aide-de-camp to
General Lord Mulgrave, the father to the present Marquis of
Normanby, who marked by his particular thanks the gallant
and able services of the elderly gentleman who had thus
volunteered to be his aide-de-camp: the events of that period
gave Mr. Graham ample means of indulging his taste for
military life: nor did he neglect any opportunity which
circumstances presented; he was always foremost in the
attack, and on one occasion, at the head of a column, when a
private soldier fell, Mr. Graham took up his musket and
supplied his place in the front rank.</p>

<p>On returning to this country, he received a letter of service
for raising a regiment in his native country, of which he was
appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant on the 10th
February, 1794, and which having been since retained on the
establishment of the army, is now the Ninetieth Light
Infantry, or Perthshire Volunteers. This regiment formed
part of the army under the command of Lord Moira (afterwards
Marquis of Hastings). It passed the summer of 1795<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
at Isle Dieu, whence it proceeded to Gibraltar. On the 22nd
of July, 1795, the rank of Colonel in the Army was conferred
on Lieutenant-Colonel Graham.</p>

<p>He continued for some months with his regiment at
Gibraltar, when he obtained permission to join the Austrian
Army. His connexion with that service continued during
the summer of 1796, taking the opportunities which his position
presented him of sending to the British Government
intelligence of the military operations and diplomatic measures
adopted by the commanders and sovereigns of the Continent:
his despatches at this period evinced, in a remarkable degree,
the great talents and characteristic energy of the writer.</p>

<p>During the investment of the city of Mantua by the French,
he was shut up there for some time with General Wurmser,
but, impatient of remaining inactive, he succeeded in making
his escape, under cover of night, encountering great difficulty
and imminent hazard.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1797, he returned to England, but in the
following autumn rejoined his regiment at Gibraltar, whence
he proceeded to the attack of Minorca with Sir Charles Stuart,
who bestowed the warmest eulogiums on the skill and valour
displayed by Colonel Graham. The part which he took in
the reduction of Minorca is thus described in a work, published
some years ago, detailing those transactions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After the debarkation of the troops innumerable difficulties
opposed themselves to their operations. There is not in any
part of Europe to be found a greater variety of natural obstacles
to an invading army than in this island. Reports from
deserters and others, contradictory in their purport, rendered
General Stuart for a short time irresolute what course to
pursue. He, however, resolved to proceed by a forced march
to Mercadel, and by possessing that essential post, to separate
the enemy's force. To effect this object, Colonel Graham
was sent with 600 men, and by dint of the utmost effort
arrived at Mercadel, a very few hours after the main body of
the enemy had marched towards Candarello. Here he made
a considerable number of prisoners, seized several dep&ocirc;ts of
ammunition, &amp;c., and established his corps in front of the
village. The reduction of Minorca being completed, Colonel
Graham repaired to Sicily, where he employed himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the service and for the assistance of its legitimate monarch;
and such were his exertions, that he received repeated acknowledgments
and tributes of gratitude and esteem from the
King and Queen of Naples."</p>

<p>In September, 1798, Colonel Graham, having been appointed
to the local rank of Brigadier-General, commanded
the force, consisting of the 30th and 89th Regiments, and
some corps embodied under his immediate direction, in the
siege of the island of Malta. Brigadier-General Graham,
aware of the prodigious strength of the place, with the assistance
of the fleet, resorted to a blockade, when, after a resistance of
nearly two years' duration, a reinforcement of troops under the
command of Major-General Henry Pigott was sent to assist
in reducing the garrison, which capitulated on the 5th September,
1800, as announced in the following despatch from Major-General
Pigott, addressed to Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph
Abercromby, then commanding the forces in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="right">"Malta, September 5, 1800.</p>

<p>"I have great satisfaction in acquainting you with the surrender
of the fortress of La Valette, with all its dependencies,
after sustaining a blockade of two years. The capitulation
has been signed this day.</p>

<p>"During the short time you were here, you must have been
sensible of the great exertions which Brigadier-General Graham
must have made with the limited force he had, previous
to my arrival with a reinforcement: he has ever since continued
these exertions, and I consider that the surrender of the
place has been accelerated by the decision of his conduct in
preventing any more inhabitants from coming out of the fortress
a short time before I came here. He was sent to negotiate
the terms of capitulation with General Vaubois, and I am
much indebted to him for his assistance in that business."</p>

<p>On the completion of this service, General Graham came
home for a few months, and, again anxious for active service,
proceeded to Egypt, but before his arrival that country
had been completely conquered. He returned through Turkey,
making some stay at Constantinople, and during the peace
of Amiens resided for a short time at Paris. His active and
enterprising spirit had now to endure a period of repose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
In 1808, however, he proceeded with General Sir John Moore
to Sweden, where he availed himself of that opportunity to
traverse the country in all directions. Shortly afterwards Sir
John Moore was ordered to Spain, and Major General Graham
served there during the whole campaign of 1808. He was
afterwards appointed to command a division in the expedition
to Walcheren, but having been attacked with fever he was
obliged to come home. In February, 1811, having been previously
raised to the rank of Lieutenant-General, he was appointed
to the command of an expedition to attack the rear of
the French army then blockading Cadiz, an operation which led
to the celebrated battle of Barrosa. The thanks of Parliament
were voted to him and the brave force under his command, and
never were thanks more nobly earned or bestowed in a manner
more honourable to those who offered and those who received
them. He was at that time a member of the House of
Commons, and in his place in Parliament he received that
mark of a nation's gratitude. In acknowledging the honour
thus conferred on him, Lieutenant-General Graham spoke as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have formerly often heard you, sir, eloquently and impressively
deliver the thanks of the house to officers present,
and never without an anxious wish that I might one day
receive this most enviable mark of my country's regard.
This honest ambition is now fully gratified, and I am more
than ever bound to try to merit the good opinion of the
house."</p>

<p>Barrosa was to Lord Lynedoch what Almaraz was to Lord
Hill, and Albuhera to Lord Beresford.</p>

<p>After this series of events, and having been appointed a
Knight of the Bath in February, 1812, Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Graham joined the army under the Duke of Wellington;
but from ill health he was obliged to revisit England for
a short period. Early in 1813, however, he returned to the
Peninsula, and commanded the left wing of the British
army at Vittoria. Mr. Abbott, then Speaker of the House
of Commons, (afterwards Lord Colchester,) in alluding to
General Graham's distinguished career at this period, stated
that his was "a name never to be mentioned in our military
annals without the strongest expression of respect and admira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>tion;"
and Mr. Sheridan, speaking of the various excellences,
personal and professional, which adorned his character,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have known him in private life; and never was there
seated a loftier spirit in a braver heart."</p>

<p>Alluding to his services in the retreat of the British army
to Corunna, he continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the hour of peril, Graham was their best adviser; in
the hour of disaster, Graham was their surest consolation."</p>

<p>He was second in command at the siege and capture of
Ciudad Rodrigo; and commanded the army employed in the
siege of St. Sebastian, and also the left wing at the passage
of the Bidassoa; but soon after, in consequence of ill health,
he was obliged to resign his command to Sir John Hope.
In 1814 he was appointed to the command of the forces employed
in Holland, and on the 3rd of May in the same year
he again received the thanks of Parliament, and was raised to
the peerage by the title of Baron Lynedoch, of Balgowan, in
the county of Perth.</p>

<p>As years advanced, and the infirmities of age began to
accumulate, Lord Lynedoch found the climate of Italy better
calculated to sustain his declining energies than the atmosphere
and temperature of his own country; he, therefore, spent
much time on the continent; but, on a recent occasion,
so anxious was he to manifest his sense of loyalty and his
personal attachment to the Queen, that when Her Majesty
visited Scotland, he came home from Switzerland for the
express purpose of paying his duty to Her Majesty in the
metropolis of his native land.</p>

<p>Lord Lynedoch's first commission in the army, that of
Lieut.-Colonel, was dated 10th February, 1794; and he
was promoted Colonel, by brevet, on the 22nd July, 1795.
His commissions in the grade of General Officer were,&mdash;Major-General,
25th September, 1803; Lieut.-General, 25th
July, 1810; and General, 19th July, 1821. He was successively
Colonel of the 90th Regiment, at the head of which
he continued nearly twenty years; of the 58th; and of the
14th Regiment, from which he was removed to the <span class="smcap">Royal
Regiment</span> on 12th December, 1834, when the Duke of
Gordon was appointed to the Colonelcy of the Scots Fusilier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
Guards. He was also Governor of Dumbarton Castle in
North Britain. He wore a Cross for his services at Barrosa
(as Commander of the Forces), at Ciudad Rodrigo, Vittoria,
and St. Sebastian (where he commanded a division), and he
was a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath, and of the foreign
Order of St. Michael and St. George.</p>

<p>To advert at greater length to Lord Lynedoch's services as
a soldier would be superfluous. Conspicuous, in action for
his talents, in council for his sagacity, and in private life for
unassuming worth and the most estimable qualities, his character
displayed a rare union of skill, chivalry, and amiability,
and his widely-spread fame, his long and intimate connexion
with the army, which have been the admiration of the present
generation, will continue to hold a prominent place in British
history. Though his titles have become extinct, he has left
behind him a name which will be held in honoured remembrance
while loyalty is considered a virtue, and military
renown a passport to fame.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sir George Murray</span>, G.C.B.,<br />

<em>Appointed 29th December, 1843</em>.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir George Murray</span> was a native of Scotland, and entered
the army at the age of 17, as an Ensign in the 71st Regiment,
on the 12th of March, 1789. He was shortly afterwards
removed to the 34th Regiment, and to the 3rd Foot Guards
in July, 1790, from which time, to the close of the war in 1815,
he was almost constantly employed in the active military service
of his country, in the Netherlands, in the West Indies, in
Egypt, in the north of Europe, and in the peninsula of Spain
and Portugal.</p>

<p>He was first under fire with the 3rd Guards in Flanders,
and participated in the campaigns of 1793 and the two following
years, being present at the affair at St. Amand, sieges
of Tamars and Valenciennes, attack of Lincelles, investment
of Dunkirk, &amp;c.; and he accompanied the army on its retreat
through Holland and Germany.</p>

<p>In 1795 he served as aide-de-camp to Major-General
A. Campbell on the expedition to Quiberon Bay; and in the
autumn he proceeded to the West Indies with the force under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Sir Ralph Abercromby. Having returned home in ill health,
he continued on the Staff of Major-General Campbell, first in
North Britain, and then in Ireland.</p>

<p>In the year 1799 Lieut.-Colonel Murray was employed in
the Quarter-Master General's department of the army under
the Duke of York in Holland; and he was wounded in the
action on the Helder. He subsequently embarked from Cork
for Gibraltar with part of the force destined to be employed
under Sir Ralph Abercromby in the Mediterranean; and,
being again placed in the Quarter-Master General's department,
he was ordered to precede the army to Egypt, for the
purpose of making arrangements for the debarkation of the
troops. He was present in the action on the landing of the
force, in the affairs of the 13th and 21st March, 1801, at the
siege of Rosetta, and the investments of Cairo and Alexandria.</p>

<p>From Egypt Lieut.-Colonel Murray proceeded to the West
Indies, where he served for twelve months in the situation of
Adjutant General.</p>

<p>Returning home, he was, in the early part of 1803, appointed
one of the Assistant Quarter-Masters General at
head-quarters; in November, 1804, he was appointed Deputy
Quarter-Master General to the army in Ireland.</p>

<p>While holding that commission he was detached, as
Quarter-Master General, with the expedition to Stralsund,
and likewise with the force employed under Lieut.-General
the Earl Cathcart at Copenhagen. He resumed his duties in
Ireland; and in 1808 was again detached, as Quarter-Master
General, with the force sent to the Baltic under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore; and when these troops proceeded
to Portugal, Lieut.-Colonel Murray accompanied that force,
and was engaged at the battle of Vimiera, at Lugo, and
Villa Franca, as well as at Corunna, and his services as a staff
officer were particularly alluded to and commended in Lieut.-General
Hope's despatch containing the account of that
victory.</p>

<p>In the year 1809 Colonel Murray was appointed Quarter-Master
General to the army under Lieut.-General Sir Arthur
Wellesley, but returned home in 1811, and in May of the
following year was appointed Quarter-Master General in
Ireland, where he remained until September, 1813, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
again proceeded to the Peninsula, and served there at the
head of the Quarter-Master General's department until the
close of the war, participating in all the important operations
of that eventful period, and evincing all the talents which
are indispensable in a staff officer with an army employed in
such arduous and trying circumstances: he received a Cross
and five Clasps for his services in the field.</p>

<p>In June, 1814, Major-General Sir George Murray was appointed
Adjutant-General to the army in Ireland, a situation
which he vacated in December following for the purpose of
undertaking the governorship of the Canadas; but on the resumption
of hostilities in the spring of 1815, he quitted
America for the purpose of joining his former companions in
arms. He did not, however, succeed in reaching the army
until the allies had entered Paris; but he continued to serve
on the Continent, with the local rank of Lieut.-General,
until the return of the Army of Occupation to England, in 1818.</p>

<p>In August, 1819, Lieut.-General Sir George Murray was
appointed Governor of the Royal Military College; in
March, 1824, he was nominated Lieut.-General of the
Ordnance, and in March, 1825, he proceeded to Dublin as
Lieut.-General, commanding the forces in Ireland, where he
remained till the year 1828, and in September, 1829, he received
the appointment of Governor of Fort George in North
Britain.</p>

<p>Sir George Murray's career was not, however, limited to
his military employments. Having sat in two successive
Parliaments as member for his native county of Perth, he
was offered the seals of office as Secretary of State for the
Colonial Department, which he accepted, and held from
1828 to 1830. His merits and talents, whether in a military
or political point of view, were thus kept in view by the Duke
of Wellington, then Prime Minister. In 1834 and 1835 he
filled the situation of Master-General of the Ordnance, and
in 1841 that appointment was again conferred upon him, and
he continued to hold it till within a short period of his decease,
which occurred on the 28th July, 1846.</p>

<p>Sir George Murray was successively Colonel commandant
of a battalion of the 60th Regiment, Colonel of the 72nd
Regiment, and of the 42nd Royal Highlanders, which he held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
upwards of twenty years, when he was removed to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">First, or Royal Regiment</span>, in December, 1843.</p>

<p>He was a Knight of the Crescent; and, in addition to the
Orders of Leopold of Belgium, St. Alexander Newski of
Russia, the Red Eagle of Prussia, the Tower and Sword of
Prussia, Maximilian Joseph of Bavaria, and St. Henry of
Saxony, Sir George Murray was decorated with the Crosses
of the First Class of the Order of the Bath, and of the Royal
Hanoverian Guelphic Order.</p>
